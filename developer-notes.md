# [Developer Notes]( #developer-notes.md )


## First Pass

Transferring the book into Markdown format, the fo=irst sections:

* [Dedication]( https://launchandlearn.github.io/index.html#online-version2/01-dedication.md )
* [About The Author]( https://launchandlearn.github.io/index.html#online-version2/02-about-the-author.md )
* [Format Of The book]( https://launchandlearn.github.io/index.html#online-version2/03-format-of-the-book.md )
* [Why You Should Read This Book]( https://launchandlearn.github.io/index.html#online-version2/04-why-you-should-read-this-book.md )
* [Make The Bed]( https://launchandlearn.github.io/index.html#online-version2/map-02-make-the-bed.md )
* [Creative Critique and Artist Within]( https://launchandlearn.github.io/index.html#online-version2/map-06-creative-critique-and-artist-within.md )

Once all the chapters have been converted to Markdow, a menu to read all the chapters sequentially - as with the first online release - will be created and added to the meu in the left side.

There are several ways the files could edited. We start with the simplest way. Every file has a button at the top of the page that links to the GitHub source code page - which provides access to any easy to use editor.
