## THE MASTER RITUALS FOR ADVANCED USERS


The master rituals are designed for advanced users who have experiences in physical, mental and spiritual rituals.  Once you have mastered and condition your body, you can then progress to this level. It should take you few months but once you are there, the 15 minutes master ritual will charge you, change you and evolve so quick that you will never look back at your old self ever again.

### The master ritual of energy and focus.

After mastering the steps in the book, you will be combining them to make sure you do what you do at higher efficiency with the highest progression, using less time and making sure whatever you do, you do with energy and strength.

After practicing those steps, you will be able to create your own master rituals, which essentially will charge you and give you an extreme amount of focus and willpower.

This extreme ritual requires you to master other steps to feel the basics, so don't overdo it with the hard approach. It is extreme, you can do a light version to feel where you will progress towards, but be careful. Once you reach the high levels, you will have the performance to charge yourself very quickly.

Know this; for some, it can take a week, and for others, it can take few months, but you have to make sure that you are not forcing yourself as your body and mind knows how to evolve. Just follow your intuition as it will guide you through the steps.

### The master morning ritual of 2 steps

The first step is mainly to charge your brain and clear your body, and also connect with your magnetic field for measuring your state and keep you focused.

Second step is to make your body perform with the simple exercise and show your body that you are in control. This ritual will help you develop control of the endocrine system even further. The main system of control of relaxation and activation in which we will discuss further in the book.

### Step one of master ritual - The frozen magnetic explosion ( F.M.E )

The purpose of this ritual is to charge your magnetic field, bring awareness to the magnetic field, make you tough and kind, charge you will electricity and make you push further than anyone could. I believe in my philosophy that a great human must be strong but must be kind at same time, and not just with emotions but with actions. Person must also be clever enough to see when someone is trying to abuse the kindness and try to help the person to find what he really wants.

The charging aspect comes from the idea that we as humans do need an electric field to keep our cells engaged and function properly! The sciences behind it is; as humans, we are a combination of many other living organisms, where the living organisms communicate with each other. When they don't communicate, the bond breaks, they separate and they search to connect with something else. Just like atoms connects with other atoms to form elements, elements connect with other elements to form cells, cells connect to form organs, organs connect to form our body and our body connects with the larger magnetic field which connects with the world. As such, when we have weak electric charge, our bodies are unable to function properly as connections are severed in the internal cells. That's why we must be aware of this. It's neither taught in biology nor any other field. People who were religious felt the electric field and tagged it aura, if you ask me that was an important finding. It made them feel good, they were literally high because the abundance of magnetic field creates mind body connection but also detoxes the body especially if you mediate between 4-6 am. There is a whole science on how melatonin converts to DMT and Valium when you meditate and melatonin production peaks at around 3 am.

Do you know that the brain doesn't need oxygen to operate in the cold? If you know a person who is about to fall into near death experience, you can save his/her brain by placing the head in a very cold environment. Place lots of ice on and around the head to save the brain. The reason when people escape death after a clinical death is because their brain continued to function, the synapses continued to send signals while the body was shutting down and doctors were fixing the failing body parts. Now you know what to do the next time you see a person having a near death experience. Simply place the head in a cold environment to ensure that the brain continues working. That way, you can keep the person alive and save his life.

People who fly to space are trained with water that is colder than 0 degrees, so if their spaceship blows or their space suit leaks, then they have to withstand an extreme amount of temperatures drop for some time while fixing an issue and being calm.

Now we are going to replace that mindset from the idea that cold is bad to cold is awesome when you reach nirvana states quicker when in it.

The benefits of cold are as follows:

* Detoxing your blood and organs.
* Strengthening the neurological systems and cardiovascular system.
* Increasing presence of mitochondria, which essentially delays neurological diseases and makes sure that your body is capable of releasing the energy super quick from its storage centers.
* It helps to increase the levels of beta-endorphins, which are super endorphins that will make you have a great mood and increase your willpower.

Frozen Magnetic Explosion is basically sitting in a super cold bath that is filled with salt water and ice. The purpose of salt is to make sure that the temperature of sub-zero degrees can be reached and also it helps to charge your body. Now in salt water, the ions will help you detox your body such that you will feel even greater as you clear the acids in your body. While sitting in the bath, you will start to control your state. When it's cold and getting colder over time, you will want to start filling it with more ice.

How do we do frozen magnetic explosion?

It’s a combination of few things into one spectrum!

1.1 Breathing technique

1.2 Awareness of the points of the body! Meditation!

1.3 Emotional state change (philosophical including hormonal)

1.4 Cold environment

1.5 Increasing levels of antioxidants in the body

1.6 Waking up early (for some this is not fun but it will be worth it)

1.7 Building an NLP anchor

1.8 Focus on the goals (seeing the big picture)

1.9 Hands together to push further the spinal fluids (optional - which increase the magnetic field.)

Let’s go deep with each point.

1.1 Breathing

The idea of breathing is simple. It’s a mechanical way of ensuring that we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide for our bodies’ requirement, so we can pump the blood and have oxygen in our system. Simply put, we are dead without breathing. Now, we can take breathing to the extreme when it makes our body alkaline and produces electricity that charges the brain and the body through pressure creation on pineal gland and as well the requirement of the body of potassium that creates electricity through out the body.

1.2 Awareness of the points in the point’s body

One of the first foundation of mindfulness and meditation is awareness of your body, it’s elements and it’s activities. I advise that you start your meditation session by paying close attention to the parts of your body that are close to the ground. This helps to ground and stabilize the mind, thereby calming the mind and preventing the mind from wandering off. Start this practice by becoming aware of your feet. Then I project your awareness to every other part of your body, relaxing every part of your body with every change of awareness.

1.3 Emotional state change

Sending love helps to shift from negative to positive. Likewise expressing gratitude also shift your state from a negative one to a positive one. You feel so much better when you are grateful for your past, present and future. You let go of attachment and pain and you also learn quicker by doin this.

1.4 Cold environment - basically cold environment helps to reduce friction and increase conductivity thereby helping with the passage of electric signals that leads to the creation of neural connections. The cold environment detoxes the body and trains cardio vascular system making it more

1.5 Detoxing the body through the increase of electrical charge, thereby allowing blood to flush toxins quicker from the body and flush them out through urine, sweat and tears

1.6 Waking up early (for some this is not fun but it will be worth it)

The brain produces melatonin at peak levels in the night and when you wake up early, you still have some of the melatonin in your system. When you meditate deeply you will initiate the conversion of the melatonin into DMT and valium which are super antioxidants and help the brain to function better.

1.7 Building an NLP anchor (NLP - Neuro linguistic programming)

I am grateful love to all! Saying the words I am whenever you are in a state where you don't want to be can change your state so you take control of your life in any situation you are in.

1.8 Focus on the goals (seeing the big picture)

After ridding your brain and body of toxins, the next thing is to focus on your goals.

1.9 Hands together to push further the spinal fluids (optional).

In order to push the spinal fluid up, place your hands together in front of you and push them in as you are trying to squeeze a lemon. This movement pushes the spinal fluid up there by making the magnetic field to circulate and expand more.

### Putting it all together

Sit in the cold shower and close your eyes. Place your hands together and focus on the lower back, breathe in fully and let go but squeeze with your stomach and pelvic muscles while imaging the point of awareness and focus going up slowly with each breath. It should take around 20 breath for it to reach the top of your head and try to focus above the point of your head. Breathe out, hold and enjoy ( optional for improving the core muscles - tuck in your stomach similar to vacuum breathing, this will make sure you train your stomach muscles and so with age, your gut wouldn't stick out and your organs will be positioned in much more optimum location inside your body).

After the point when you need to breathe, breathe deep and hold, squeeze in your pelvic muscles and push your stomach in. Now think on the stuff that need to be done. Focus on your goals! You are in a much positive state so you will do it. Your adrenaline level will increase and whatever was stuck in your veins and blood you will clear out. Your body is now alkaline and you most likely have reached state that is associated as nirvana or ecstasy when brain has abundance of gamma waves as your brain now is fully charged and syncing.

Your body is getting colder and as a protection mechanism, it pushes the blood towards your organs so you have abundance of oxygen and you reach the state of clarity and focus.

With meditation, this is gonna sound like lecture but I will try to summarize something it took years for me to understand. Through different experimentation, research from many different books, lectures and seminars.   I love the approach of science and here I am giving it to you who ever reads it.

The reason I went through different sciences is to go deep and to understand the need to do something and how to look at different angles that different sciences provide. To make it more effective and be able to progress and go further, you need to understand that the harder you try to switch off your thoughts, the more you will have them as you actually make your brain work faster since you send a signal to the brain that something is going on. You need to adopt the idea of observing your thoughts.

It is impossible to shut down your thoughts, what you can do is to redirect your energy and focus it to another part of the brain that doesn't have that internal voice which can place you in the state of a zone.

To train that, you need to sit and observe your thoughts. Don't judge, don't care, you just think and look at your thoughts, disengaging yourself from emotions. When you do this, the brain will automatically slow down the brain wave frequency and you will move from the state of default mode to a more primed zone.

Now, when you become an observer of your thoughts, blood and electricity will move to the part of the brain that develops self-control as well as other things. You will also experience increased focus and healing. Also, you will experience increased open thinking which helps with idea generation, seeing the whole picture with intuition and essentially the control of your state throughout the day.

When it comes to meditation, you need to fully understand what meditation is in order to have a great meditation.  Also, you have to feel what it is and how to know the different states. While meditating, you might feel a tingling sensation or like someone is touching your head. This feels good comes from a part of the brain called pineal gland or third eye. The pineal gland is responsible for the release of serotonin and melatonin. If you meditate to super deep levels, the melatonin converts to DMT and Valium which is a component you find in drugs. These compounds have high anti oxidation power which heals the body and see to it that the brain rewires itself and change your priorities to more important ones.

I remember when I started meditation. It felt like someone touches my lobe whenever I was meditating. It is a great feeling, it felt like someone was on standby to massage my head all day long.

If while meditating, you feel pain in your head, it shows that your brain needs to detox. The brain feels the accumulated toxins the moment you starting building neural connection, so detox first.

Meditation has helped me so much that it made me develop self-awareness and also effect changes in my life. Take for instance: whenever I drink tap water, I feel a sharp pain in my head like I'm been pricked by needle. I soon discovered that my body wanted me to drink bottled or filtered water, not tap water. This clearly shows that meditation helps to change one's lifestyle

### Ok so what is meditation?

So imagine the brain as the machine that has different brain wave frequencies! When you sleep it works at slow frequency and when you wake, its works at a fast frequency as you have information coming in and your brain is trying to figure out if its danger or something you love.

So, there are different frequencies here and you will understand each definition of them.

Here are the brain waves:

1 Beta fully functioning awake
2 Alpha Waking up (watching TV, relaxed) (meditation at beginning)
3 Theta - Just about to fall asleep or wake up (really deep meditation)
4 Delta Sleep waves
5 Gamma (super deep meditation) also known as nirvana

The whole idea is that the brain is an electromagnetic field that sends signals.  It sends signals based on the awareness that we have and when you develop your awareness, you develop the focus as well. The idea of convergence and divergent thinking applies when you can narrow your focus like a lens and feel towards specific part of the body that will send the blood and all the required nutrients towards that area to heal faster. It’s not magic, basically you tell your body to heal by telling where to send the nutrients to break down the dead cells away and give birth to the new ones.

How to meditate? I am 100% sure that you will feel the benefit of it straight away.

### So how to do it.

As soon as you wake up, don't check anything, and don't check your mail. The reason for this is your brain processed all the information while sleeping and will start to speed up when you wake up. Close your eyes and observe. This will train the brain to get there, you will catch your brain waves before it turns into beta waves and they will sit more on Alpha waves throughout the day and that's it. For me, mornings are more convenient as I fall asleep in front of my art or what I do, or reach the state where I am too tired and just pass to bed to sleep!

### Things to note

One of the big things that you can do is, when you meditate you can influence your subconscious and memory of the body, the reflexes and the way the body believes the world is. The assumption that we are aware of some things and not about others is because we have those things in our unconscious belief system and when you meditate you can change the beliefs the same what hypnosis does.

Also, you should know that when you meditate, more blood rushes to the brain and less to the body and that grows the brain.

### What happens when you meditate?

When you mediate:

* You will lower inflammation.
* The body will improve its immune system.
* You will be more present throughout the day.
* The brain will work so much better. Your memory, cognitive function and self-control will start to rewire itself.

You can also sit in a cold bath; I don't know if you have tried this but I can tell you that it's more advanced. And because our brain can work in the cold without oxygen it start to speed up. You know like frogs in winters they freeze in ice and after the ice melts, they continue hoping because their brain is still functioning. Humans can't really do that in ice as they have much more complex system.

Train more to balance yourself so you can control your state and not be attached to anything and live life fully. You will have the brain that will be able to reach those states of mind that is called 'flow.' Your brain will be silence, and it will focus on extreme temperature, and when it is silent, you will go into a very deep meditation. As such, combining the meditation and the cold environment helps to improve the performance of the brain. When the environment is not an easy one, you will train, and you will thrive as you are prepared. Also, one of the things all of us have is this internal chatter, and people who meditate try to eliminate it through long hours of meditation. When you jump into a cold environment, you will feel your internal chatter shutting up; this is called default mode of the brain that we can influence and change. The more you're in a flow, the easier to get there, so if you do it every day in the morning, you can just get to it by thought.

When you are inside the cold environment, to amplify the effect and charge your brain with positivity, say this to yourself: "I am grateful love to all".  You can ask yourself where is your focus is at. The focus makes meditation and focusing on your pineal gland ensure that your brain waves slow down so you will feel calmer and focus on a specific aspect that you want and influence yourself more effectively. The sending of love and gratitude are all instrumental parts to make you feel great and connected, and all the love will make sure that your identity is truly given to the society. Here I’ve traded this book with you to pass you the knowledge on how to connect with the world.

Warning: When you feel that your skin is burning, make sure you get away from the cold as fast as possible; that means you are overdoing it or when you don’t feel it.

### What do you require for a cold environment?

A Bathtub with ice or some sort of cooling system and bath salt. Another option is a cryogenic chamber, though it's an expensive machine. To be honest, I did get burns from it once, and the owner of the spa center thought that I would sue her, but personally, I don't like those people who sue others to obtain a financial reward. It was actually a fun experience and I enjoyed the experience, even though I have a scar on my body. What I am saying is it has dangers of its own because you are prone to inhaling liquid nitrogen and if care is not taken, it can kill you.

### Step two of the master ritual

#### The genetic shake up

The reason why we engage in sports is to energize our body and make our body fit. Your genetics should resonate with the desires that you have not some circumstances. Fitness level is an expression of what your body is capable of doing. When you are fit, it's obvious you will push your limit on health and other things to get even fitter to be capable of doing more. Now, the genetic shake up is all about focusing the exercise in a way that will make you super strong and have other aspects added to it. If can tell that your brain and your body is following the genetic shake up closely, then you are a person that is capable of a great achievement.

We will discuss the progression science in a sport step, but there is a superset that I've developed which is tough and can be easily progressed over time. I call it the Kettle/Rope madness.

### Kettle/Rope madness

Do as many kettlebell swings in one go; you will want to hit heavier weights when you reach above 50-100 reps in one attempt as it can get a bit boring. After you're done with those, take battle ropes and do swings to push other muscles in motion and keep your heart rate elevated. Then, you can finish with plank, but the main one is kettlebell swing. Remember that it uses most of the muscles and develops more than any other equipment, the Beauty of kettlebell is that it burns more muscles and produces the quickest result to the body hormonally.

If the battle ropes is not an option, you can do this instead to keep your heart rate elevated. With completing the set by circling kettlebell around your shoulder. The reason why I will prefer the battle ropes for the second part of the set is that kettlebell swings and battle ropes require you to increase your VO2 max, as both consume a lot of oxygen and make your body crave for it, therefore, expand your cardiovascular system by the pure demand of the body.

Now it's a heavy set, so hitting from 2-6 sets is a good guideline, make sure you are listening to your body. Make sure to check out how to do the kettlebell swings, battle ropes or if battle ropes not an option than pull up bar and do press ups and also how to do planks as it’s important to do it right which you can finish with. After waking up, shower, and get dressed, and here you go - you did three sets.

It takes 30-40 minutes a week and you can really progress with ease with nearly no equipment. To measure the performance just do maximum number of reps of kettle bell swing in one set or do few with a minute break in between it’s your choice.

###  The right diet while on master ritual

Do the kettle set in the morning and do it in the evening to make the body crave nutrients and produce growth hormones for its shape and development. The idea here is to go on intermittent fasting with increasing fasting window by training in the evening and as soon as you wake up. So if you eat in 3-4 hours window, then you will make sure that your food will be distributed across the body and you will have a longer intermittent fasting session. And if you eat once a day, then you will have an even greater kick.

I usually eat in the evenings or lunchtimes and not eat any other time. So if you eat at 2 and eat in the evening at around 5-6, then exercising in the evening can burn off the calories that you consumed so you go back into fasting mode, which is ketogenic. Socially wise, if you eat at 2 and 6, which is like having lunch and dinner with people to connect deeper, you can also cut it to just 5-6pm where you eat and do few sets an hour later, which will most likely distribute whatever you ate into recovery and building the strength. If my target is to loose fat tissue than I will eat in the morning as soon as I wake up but that’s periodically. Switching up is important as you don’t allow your body to go out of balance and be ready if things change around. Our ideas of food consumption, and our lifestyle in general makes us tired and stressed due to the fact that we are abusing our body with not allowing it to filter out junk out of our system.

What you should do is to eat the right food that charges your body with electricity so you function better and eat only once or twice a day to shorten the feeding window so you can have a period of time where you are fasting throughout the day.  With an exercise in the morning, you burn out all the free energy in the body and if you do a session in the evening you will use up what you've eaten for lunch and if you just eat lunch, then you have a huge window. The body will start to produce growth hormones during the fasting window; it can rise up to 5 more times than the usual amount within 24 hours and if you do that regularly you will have a much healthier body so you can be more mobile throughout your life and live longer. It's important that you drink plenty of water so that your body can accommodate nutrients.


## Summary of the book

Like I mentioned at the beginning of the book, this book is a result of my past experiences and I'm looking to add value to you and the society. I intended this book for those who want to achieve greatness in life. I believe you want to, otherwise you wouldn't be reading this book.

It's natural to set goals and thirst for success, as a matter of fact, everyone wants to achieve greatness. However, greatness doesn't happen overnight or happen because I wish to be successful. No, you and I have got to be full of energy and directs our energy towards what we want to pursue - our dreams, greatness. Working towards the realization of your goals is a constant refining process, where you develop your wisdom, health, wealth and happiness.

Firstly, this book helps you to create focus, be focused and remind you of the goals you have set for yourself on a daily basis so you can imprint them inside you till they become who you are. Then, you go further to start the circulation process of oxygen and blood in your body. The circulation of oxygen and blood in the body charges your brain to perform better and build positivity around you. You go on to engage in exercise designed to make you more combative so you can tackle challenges head on.
