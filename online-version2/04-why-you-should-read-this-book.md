### Why am I doing this?

I am doing this to figure out myself and have an understanding of who I really am. There are so many things to consider in life and writing a book about the answers to the questions in a structured manner is the best way to understand it. Finding the synergy involves living a life worthy of emulation, asking a question and seeking answers. In our lifetime, we will learn some things to an extent, and the future generation will continue where we left. Writing my findings helps me discover things that I believe have the power to influence us. And instead of learning one thing specifically, I decided to focus on the foundation of many others and see how they relate and affect each other. I'm doing this to explore things in depth, learn from one root to a different one while being charged with enough energy to learn more and add value to the society. I'm of the opinion that sharing information helps us to grow. Though I cherish privacy, I'd rather I share the information that can benefit all rather than keep it for just a few people. That's why we should come together to exchange ideas and exchange knowledge so we can brew it and shape new and better ideas to solve problems that require a new approach.

I want to share an example of the multi-vertical talent that I modelled to understand how a person can view the future with the use of logic and not euphoric states. Da Vinci was an inventor, painter, musician and a researcher of nature. He could imagine the flying machines centuries before anyone could by associating the birds and causalities of their movements. He could do it before the technologies, and supporting sciences came to being. Though I advise people to see everything, I still implore them to be focused on things that they believe will produce the greatest value so they can apply the knowledge.

I believe 100% in what I say, but I also believe that all what I am saying is written in the language that was taught to us by our past generations.

In this case, I am a curious messenger who likes to experiment with himself and to live a better life by finding new ways to do that.

### What triggered me?

Another reason why I am writing this book is to answer the many questions and structure the knowledge in me. I want to make sure that everyone fined answers to all the question they have been inkling to answer. I want to ensure that everyone does what want. Just like I have gotten some answers from my personal experiences, I want to share these answers with others and make them the light of life full of awareness as opposed to the ignorant darkness they were before.

The first thing that triggered me to write this was my encounter at a trip I took to the Lake District. At the Lake District, I went on a walk with wolves, and the wolf keeper said something that struck me. The idea that the brain of wolves is 20% denser and not spoiled as that of the dogs; even though both dogs and wolves have almost the same origin. Another trigger was an experience that led me to the hospital. I have taken too much of alkaline water which pushed my brain into an overdrive and formed hallucinations that I couldn't explain. This experience of mine made me search deeply into neuroscience and how we function. I carried out different research because I want to develop habits for people thereby adding value and making myself useful to the society. I discover that time once used never comes back, so I resolved to make the best use of my time and get effective results from it.

If you take a moment to observe the wolf and all the animals in the world, you will find that the stuff they did to survive made them stronger and increased density of their brain. This is the reason why you need to do more to challenge yourself. At the end of the day, you will not just survive; you will soar higher and be faster than time itself. I'm doing this so that you can ride your waves more skillfully than you did before. I'm doing this to challenge you to ride the waves that are larger than the ones before.

### Good questions give great answers!

A good question brings about a great answer. In turn, a great answer leads to a great decision and a great decision leads to a greater life. Over the years, I have answered different questions, and I have gathered enough information to answer many question you may have.

Some questions I had to ask. How can I make a reader locked on this book? How do I make this book valuable to a reader? How do I get information on a specific topic? How do I structure and format the book for easy reading and understanding of the reader? Do I have enough resources to carry out experiments? Which other fields of science does this book touch? These are two questions I asked myself just so the reader can understand the book and the purpose of the book can be realized. I believe enlightening someone is all about showing the true nature of the subject matter so the reader knows what to do and where to go from there.

### Comments on Freedom and Discipline.

I understand that self-development takes time and requires discipline, but the truth is the activity saves and makes time. Self-development helps you work faster and also make decisions with positive outcomes. Think of the time you spend on developing yourself as an investment that will pay off in the nearest future. Think of the time as the tiny effort that will give you freedom and help you form a habit that will change your life for the better.

I advise people not to implement too many habits at once. The body needs time to get adjusted to new habits. If you force yourself to do ten new things every day, you will find it difficult to keep up. I try not to push myself too much in a day. It took me a very long time to write this book. I make sure that I do more in less time, relax and come back to my work when I feel the need to continue. We aren't all wired the same way so our bodies need time to adapt and build a connection with the brain. The brain needs to send a feedback to the body that the activity you are doing benefits you, and if you do many activities at one time, you might confuse the brain.

Where do I start? Which habit do I implement first? Before you rush into making these decisions, I'd advise you to ask yourself what drives you. Ask yourself why you want to do this. I can provide information and guidelines but there is a need for you to answer who you are as a human being, what you do and what you want to do. It's only after you answer these questions that will you be successful at whatever you try out. The activities I penned down in this book are guidelines to follow to get to your destination quicker. These activities are catalyst that speeds up the race to your destination.  In general, it takes about 20 to 60 days to master a habit, so add the habits one after the other with 20 days interval between them. Developing a new habit requires self-control; to change your life for the better, you need to change yourself first and to do that, you need to develop and master habits that support a better life. You need to understand that disciplining yourself doesn't take much time when compared to the time it takes to regret the potential you have missed. This is to say that you spend so much time regretting the potentials you have missed when you could have spent less time to discipline yourself. So which do you want to do? Discipline yourself or regret?

Another important aspect of self-development is feeding your mind positive thoughts on a daily basis. What happens on the outside affects the inside, as such, you need to guard your thoughts ensuring that your critical mind rids itself of the negative aspect of the world that wants to hinder the identity you want to shape. Also, it's important that you strengthen your body. Prepare your body for the task ahead. Make sure that you do everything with ease.

What will you become after implementing ideas from this book? You will become charged like a clean magnet that is charged with energy and clean as nature purposed for you to be. You will develop the feeling of awareness that will help you control your emotions and state. Your health and status will be developed. Those two can be achieved when you know what you want to do. You will at the end own yourself more than before. You will truly live the life that you want, and not react to the environment but make the environment act the way you think is right. You will be disciplined. You will be free.

### It’s about consistency, not the intensity.

Going to the gym for 10 hours once in a while doesn't get you into shape, but going to the gym every day for just 20 minutes will. A person doesn't fall in love in one second. It's after being present and giving yourself for a long time that you will realize you are growing with the person and you will do whatever it takes for them. Truth be told, many great inventions and projects take years to complete and sometimes it takes a year to figure out.

It's about doing activities and getting there through accumulation that will bring you to the point where you can say that you've achieved the desired result. The consistency will help you progress through stages in life. You are responsible for your life. You can only change your life when you take charge.

### Sundays

Sundays are probably the best days to review your performance and what you did throughout the week. If you are looking to shed some pounds, Sunday is the best day to measure your weight loss effort. If you have performance review in your company, Sunday is the ideal time to think about your performance.  It's a bit isolated as many performances are based on group effort, but sometimes, the review of your performance on Sundays is ideal for group stuff, and you can try Wednesdays as it’s probably the toughest day on average and doing a review can set you in good motion.

### The First 20 Minutes Are Super Important after waking up.

The moment you wake up, your brain moves from subconscious mode to conscious mode, and that's is the best time to influence your identity. The easiest way to change your mindset or a negative paradigm is to influence your subconscious the moment you wake up. If you are familiar with hypnotherapy and fortune tellers, you will find that they use your state of trance against you. That is, they place you in a state of trance as it’s the best time to relate their ideas and make you agree with them.

Another time to influence your identity is when you are meditating. It's important that you have guidance when you are meditating as the guide will give you an understanding of how to get to the state.

Now, I've designed the first steps to help you rewire your subconscious and reach your objectives faster.

Note that the activities listed after step 5 are mainly for health, energy, building your toughness, expression of art and longevity. Also, I listed the two master rituals that are important for the brain. The second master ritual targets the brain. Though the ritual may seem difficult if you are just starting out, but the sooner you master it, the faster you will understand the benefits and use it to your advantage.

### The definition of success.

What are the important members of success?

Wisdom - to seek knowledge on a constant basis and utilize the knowledge gained.

Discipline - developing self-control and taking necessary action.

Energy - The reserve of energy to take action

Focus - the direction you are determined to go.

Some are of the opinion that luck is also important. They believe that one can develop luck and its elements by increasing by chances by chaining their activities and the environment.

### The structure of the book
