## MAP 5: JOURNAL MEDITATION

The story of life: Wake up, prepare an amazing breakfast comprising of lots of pancakes for yourself. You sit down to eat and while eating, you check the time only to realize that you have to stop your meal immediately otherwise you'd be late for your 9am appointment. Then, you dash out of the house. Some minutes later, your wife wakes up to find the kitchen dirty and the dishes unwashed. She's angry and she thinks of you as an asshole who can't seem to look after himself. When you return home in the evening, your wife in her elevated brain state calls you a moron. What do you do? You do one of two things. It's either you snap at her or you say something that make her appeal towards you. Emotions and brainwaves are a tad related. Your brain spikes when you overheat it. So, there is a need for you to pause and give your brain time to process when you are in difficult situations.

Want to know why I placed Journaling, planning and meditation in one map? That's because they are all related. If you observe philosophies like Buddhism of the West, otherwise known as stoicism, you'll find that there are many ways to achieve the same thing and in this case, self-actualization works. During meditation, you slow down to observe and likewise when you journal, you slow down and observe. Both meditation and Journaling are similar but the difference is they are done in different ways. In both, you can analyze or can let go. Doing both can help you select what you want the most and what suits you the most.

In this chapter, I will teach you how to make your third eye cry. In this case, your third eye is your biological clock that knows how you use your time. The moment you start to realize how you use your energy, you will be more aware and you will become a spiritual expert who is strong, intelligent and kind. This is what I want you to achieve with this book.

In this chapter, we will discuss different ways of meditating, planning and Journaling as well as the science behind it to make you understand yourself better.


### The benefit from the previous steps

Previous action (cold environment) charged your brain and your body. I know it sounds simple, but the essence of the cold environment is to charge you up. Through the use of the abundance of breathing and liquid, you provide the charge for your body. The cold environment cleared your system and charged your blood, and ensured that your brain has increased its electric charge which you will have to increase further with analysis and meditation.

### The main differences between meditation and journaling

No doubts, meditation and Journaling are different and there are quite a number of things that differentiates them. I have penned down information about each one to differentiate them.


### Journal

The change of state comes in the journal as you are targeting your analysis and your state is of mind is realistic, but pessimistic or optimistic.

The idea of an analysis. The idea of living a life and having some time to stop and reflect on why you did something. This ensures that you understand yourself better and make decisions that agree with your values.

The idea of planning involves evaluating the available resources and making the decisions that aligns with your values. Though some people agree with the idea of going with the flow, I personally believe that you should plan some aspects of your life in such a way that will allow you live on your terms.

You can plan differently; you can observe your past and evaluate on how you are moving and towards which direction. Planning will help you figure out the things to say to and the ones you should ignore.

A person who wants it all and has no plan is ignorant of what to do. A person with a purpose knows where to start. While having a plan is good, having a purpose is much better.


### Meditate

The idea of doing an activity as an observer rather than a victim will make you the controller of your body and therefore, your life. The idea of controlling your information field which is essentially a mechanism that allows your internal processes to work in sync and to rewire your brain from the default mode of our ancestors to the more evolved state of analysis and control.

Meditation has two key components; rewiring your brain and charging your internal processes to work in sync. These two components come together to reevaluate your external and internal world, thereby making it convenient for you to live a fulfilled life. The spectacular thing about meditation is that it detaches you from the emotions that declouds your priorities, and helps you to form a new habit.

Also, another benefit of meditation is keeping you focused. Meditation helps to change your thought pattern as it directly influence your unconscious and subconscious mind which in turn changes your identity. Your thoughts create reality through expression; meditation allows you to reason your thoughts, detach from the ones that won't get you anywhere and focus on the ones that are helpful.

Self-awareness helps with personal growth as you will start to know what needs to be done in life. Meditation helps you to think critically on things to ensure that you engage in the most important things.

The purpose of meditation is to feel the vibration and oneness and then change it to what makes you happy. The idea of motivation is the one that agrees that the body can heal itself better than medicine by focus and the use of pituitary gland. When you focus your energy on your body, there is a huge rush of blood flow and energy will be distributed to rid your body of illness.

To get the best from meditation, make efforts to manage your energy and master it. Also, ensure that you are passionate about whatever you do. Likewise, you need to be mindful of how and where you expend your energy.

Just like binaural beats where you take yourself to the meditative state , meditation also requires that you train your brain to place yourself in a state of meditation and self-awareness that reduces the brain waves and changes how your body react to the environment.


### The big picture

There is nothing that should be considered as complex in this planet. Why? Everything you consider as complex has a multi-level structure and once you allow yourself time to digest it, you'd find that it isn't complex like you pictured. This is where meditation comes in. If you are a fan of personal growth, you should understand that everything is possible. All you need is to give yourself time, expend your energy and focus.

Have a vision of the future! If you ask me, I'd say that visualization and meditation is the best form of leisure. The period of mediation is the time when your brain obtains the information in the world, process them and make decisions, and then send a signal to your body to take action.

Every human being has a similar wiring on their basic needs and when these needs are fully understood, the body and humans will live a correct life.  In order to have an understanding of the future, you have to really understand the past. Meditation calms you to reflect on the past and think deep into the future.

Meditation supports the brain like an information architect that reorganizes the information into different categories that are more or less important for reproduction and survival.

When you meditate and visualize, you rewire your brain and that leads to the brain working more efficiently. You re-structure your internal value system and disengage emotionally on things that doesn't matter to you and connect with things that matters. Meditation helps you to visualize the things that are important to you. Meditate today!


### Journal types, meditation, and planning

#### I G.O.T. love

The "I G.O.T. LOVE" journal is a daily journal with five elements - Identity (who you are), Gratitude (what you are thankful for), Objectives (Your targets and goals for a particular period), Time (the day you set down the schedule and break down into parts) and Love (sending love meditation).

You can use your diary or journal, and if you're using a computer, make sure to keep just one text file with a to-do list or calendar open.  You can type this in an everlasting word document while marking the dates at the start of each day - this makes everything organized; remember that this is mainly for you.

Also, you can place the I G.O.T Love in a different order but I feel the order of identity, gratitude, objectives, time and love is right as it helps to: direct your life, ease your pain from past experiences, helps you to plan while living in the moment. There is a need for us to let go of past pains, and future frustration so we can live in the moment.  I will not mention how long you should do each part of the journal, or how many times to write each part. What is important is to do it as many times as you feel is right. Trust your feeling on this one. For ease, you can set a minimum time or amount to write, and if you are a person that wants a reassurance to yourself that you did a minimum, then do that.

Another journal you can use is "I'm grateful love to all". This one is a bit simpler and it comprises if your identity, objectives, gratitude and love.

This is the simple illustration of Journaling: The brain of a hardworking mom who barely has time to sleep, and as such, her brain couldn't process any information. She has been tired for so long and now, she resolved to make a change. She decided that it's time for a change and she needs to create her life and not live subjected to her circumstances. She sits, thinks, and writes all of it on a piece of paper. And every morning when she wakes up, she reflects on what she wants and at one piece at a time, things started to come to her.


### Identity.

Having an understanding of who you are, while having an identity that supports your vision helps to propel your understanding of life.  Identity helps you figure out who you are in this infinite puzzle; it reminds you of who you are and the things you have accomplished.  As a trick, you can think of future accomplishment as past ones making you super certain that you worked, so you will not shake when the obstacle arises. If you say I did this, when you're actually about to, then your brain believes that you did it, and doesn't doubt it as it believes it's done. This defines the outcome and focuses on your body, and this changes the state if you say it with emotion.

If you want to change, there is a need for you to take your time because identity shaping requires time. You will have to change your thoughts and daily patterns of life as they set the unconscious understanding of who you are.

Thoughts and feeling make attitude. Attitude over a period of time creates beliefs and beliefs are in your Subconscious. Beliefs overs a period of time create a perception, and that is in the unconscious. Perception is a pure identity as you will look from the eyes that you created. The self-trust is super important. Trust in yourself and time will help you get what you want.


### Relationship between evolution and identity

Many people try to find themselves and look through the prism of their life that they've consciously lived. If you really want to change, you have to understand two other things in you. Your instinctual; which was passed through evolution and your upbringing. Our brain, our values, and our fundamental ideas are formed when we are children. It's as people say we live half of our life until 2, the rest will be lived until 80. As kids, we were innocent and we did things without awareness and our identity was forming with our brain as we were importing the knowledge that we were gaining.

The Period of imprinting and formation of new language learning allows you to learn quicker. A baby doesn't learn, it imprints, which is quicker as the brain structure changes. If you look at birds, it will sing its parents song as its imprinting. This is longer to take away, and we can work on this with reverse emotions. The idea of imprinting shapes your identity, and your childhood did a major part in shaping it. That's why you see tons of advertisement for kids because it takes long to change their habits when they are adults. When a kid learns and develops the ability to develop further, the kid builds its structure of knowledge and behaviors which will transform into other aspects of life that will help shape his/her identity.  If you really want to change your identity, you will have to go deep to try to figure out what built you your beliefs and your perceptions.

This may sound funny but if you want to become a great human, you have to be a great animal first. Funny yeah? Animals have morals too. For example, animals of the same type don't go for fatal attacks, they hit on the ears and big lips, not fatal but for pain, not for damage. In the case of dogs; when dogs fight, instead of a bloody battle, what you see is a psychological battle that creates hierarchy. The point is to have morals and be disciplined.

Now, the identity of a human being was shaped a lot from childhood. Excuse me for going deep into the psychology of children; the psychology of children helps you to understand your identity. Have you ever wondered why a child has no capacity to do anything in order to survive than just being cute? Or why babies of monkeys are able to do more things when they are born? Why they grab to the mothers and get carried? Monkeys don't have the neuroplasticity as humans do, so that's why we are born incapable to run but we can evolve much further. While some people have some aspect developed, others are underdeveloped.

Now imagine a situation where you wake up and build a neurological condition that keeps you focused, happy and strong. Imagine doing this every day, how strong do you think the neurological condition would be? This activity is referred to as a NLP anchor. When you intensify the NLP anchor with more emotions, the anchor becomes stronger and can change the state of your mind anytime and anywhere simply saying or thinking two words, "I am". The NLP anchor and identity isn't about an egotistical identity defined by category or progression that limits human brain from using their initiatives and thinking outside the box. No! The NLP anchor allows you to create a neurological response which will fire your synapses in a particular way. We can only produce an astounding work when we are in an extreme state of happiness, confidence, and certainty that things will work out.

To engage in this exercise, all you need to do is to close your eyes. Close your eyes and reflect on your best experiences in life. Imagine it, live it, feel it and declare to yourself that "I am". Confess that you are strength; you are love; you are light, you are confident and you are an infinite abundance. Stop for a while and breathe, then confess that you are thankful. Make your environment as quiet as possible to get your brain connected simply by saying those two words. Say it many times like a morning ritual, and that will help build "I AM" NLP Anchor. Whenever you feel the situation is getting out of control, say that to yourself or out loud. This exercise is super important as it helps to charge your body and brain instantly. You can apply the "I Am anchor" when you are in a negotiation and the other person seem to be having the upper hand. Transform your ego into I AM. Having an ego is one thing but when you transform it into "I am," you then focus on changing your identity to grow instead of focusing on protection and aggression.

Also, there is a need for you to connect with your instincts and live in self-awareness. Being aware of your instincts will help you connect with your subconscious, which will in turn propel you to what you want and reprogram your identity. The only hindrance to getting what you want are the stories that you have playing in your head. There are so many stories that we create, and that makes life different from what it is.

Self-esteem also comes into play here. Self-esteem is the reputation that you have with yourself.  Oftentimes, I see many parents bring up a case of children working hard to guarantee happiness. Children are now stuck in the race of constant satisfaction through labor and hard work instead of being happy and expressing themselves through love.


### The clothes you wear and how they shape your identity

We all spend a little extra effort to look all glammed up for special occasions. But the truth is, we remain conflicted between dressing up and feeling guilty about wasting time out of our busy schedule to focus on clothes. Science has suggested that how we dress up in our personal and professional lives projects who we really are. Oftentimes, we hear sayings like "dress like the person you want to be and not who you are”; "dress for the job you desire and not the one you have ". However, most people do not believe in these claims though they make sure that their attires fit in into any occasion they are going to. Science has proven that the clothes we wear defines who we are, affects our attitudes, behavior, confidence, mood, personality and how we relate or interact with others. This is referred to as Enclothed Cognition. The term Enclothed cognition describes the effect that clothes have on psychological processes such as attitudes, emotions, interpersonal interactions and self-evaluations. Even so, clothes affect our mood and behavior because of the meaning the society attaches to different kinds of attire. We tend to evaluate people we are meeting for the first time based on the type of attire they have on. We consider some attires to be fun, casual, powerful and so on. We even go aboard to evaluate ourselves using what we wear at a particular time. This shows that the experience of wearing a subtle attire affects our choice of behavior and attitude.
The idea of mastering for your identity.
There were turning moments in my life when I had to make certain decisions to change. Then I decided to work smart instead of working hard and instead of doing things just for the sake of doing, I resolved to doing what I love doing while ensuring that I rest, develop faster and recover as each day passes by. In my experience, I have learnt that when people walk the talk, everything becomes real. Like I mentioned earlier that this book is a compilation of my experiences and my experiences that I’ve gathered through out my life.

This book helped me find myself more than anything could have, and it helped me find my identity. This book is my value system and what I can do for society to help it grow.


### Master your self

 Mastering your state and making sure that you have control over yourself. Building your identity, ensuring that you are healthy and you live in self-awareness. Building your skill set and awareness, so you can easily identify when your body is in a state of focus or exploration, so you can go with the flow and do what your body is best at, at that moment. The healthy mind is an organized mind.


### Master the environment

Learn quickly from the environment. Understand the environment and know where you can explore, develop ideas and flow when needed. Gather experiences from your environment. Learn new experiences by reading books, taking trips, trying out new foods, watching movies, studying foreign languages, acquiring new perspectives and learning new words. Stimulate your brain to develop new concepts and improve the old ones in new ways. Thus, affecting your behavior and future predictions.


### Master the fun

Master the aspect of having fun. Engage in social interaction, communication, and change your philosophical value structure so you can have meaningful fun. Enjoy real and deep fun, not on the surface level fun.


### Master the future

For family and future generation so they will pass the knowledge to future generations. Creating a value structure and strength in individuals, so they do things that are important. Focus and commitment will help you achieve what you want. Everything here are tools, state changers, and skill builders, but you have to define your goals and what drives you.

### Examples

These are some examples on how to change your identity and develop your thought pattern when you are in a journaling mode. Write these in there and feel it.

Example 1: I am who I am. I am the person who created (X) because of (Y). I've made this and sold this; my growth is X. I am a human that can do anything that I put my mind to, and I will live a life of glory where honor and respect is a must.

Example 2: These are your confessions: I am the Spartan. I live the life of victory, and I accept no defeat. The glorious death of virtue is waiting for me. Surrender is not my option, and I only do what I believe is necessary. I spend on things that are needed, and use my energy where I can produce most value to society.

Example 3: I am who I am…. I am the writer of the book that helped the most people achieve their dreams. I am the person who researched the depth of the environment and nature. I am who I am; I am the person who observed a variety of different views and sciences to figure out how I can combine different fields to form new habits that make me more efficient and helpful.

Example 4: I am a mentor to (Z) and a father to (T). It's my job to be the best for them and to be the person that is an example for them. I am the person who will die for them if needed, and I live with the purpose to make their lives better.

### Gratitude

Before you can make any changes to your actions, there is a need for you to change your state first. You can't expect people to achieve great things or carry out great tasks if they are not in their peak state. Hence, the reason why the next step is gratitude. This section is designed to help you achieve peak state all through the day so you can deal with any obstacles that come your way and grow with more joy and less stress. Have you noticed that when you are grateful for the things that happened in the past, your mood turns into a positive one? A positive mood helps you to focus on the moment and the things you can change. Over time, you will become so used to gratitude such that you will look forward to the experience, smile in the face of obstacles and be glad that obstacles exist because they challenge you and make you better.

The second big thing about gratitude is it helps you to let go of the past and make you achieve more things in the present since your brain isn't focused on things that happened in the past. When you are grateful for your past experiences, you are sending a signal to your brain to let them go. Likewise, gratitude makes you humble and present. All the negative experiences you had in the past are meant to make you better and drive you to become tougher, not bring you down. This is why you should be grateful for the experiences. Writing them in a journal and reflecting on how they have changed you will help you become the best version of yourself. Some of the successful people you look up to today also went through unimaginable pain and they came out tougher. So, you need to be grateful for your past experiences as they will propel you to be a better and tougher person. The idea of living in the past starts when you stress yourself and when you stress yourself, it wears off the brain. So being grateful for your past experiences also tells on your health, not just your psychology.

I'm of the opinion that the universe relies on your gratitude and when you are grateful, the universe pays you back by bringing to you people who will help you live a fulfilled life. As you learn and master the act of gratitude, you will become grateful for the things you have. And the more you are grateful for the things you have, the more universe gives.

Some examples of gratitude are as follows:

I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the love my family and friends have showed me all these years. I am grateful for the person I have around me. I am grateful for my life and how far I have come. I am grateful for the pain my friend caused me when we were kids. I am grateful for it because the pain made me realize that we need guidance. I am grateful for the friends who challenged me to become a better person. I am grateful for people who looked down on me. I am grateful for the love I send and the value I have added to people. I am grateful for my past, my future and my health.


### Objectives

Goals are very important as they keep you in check and focused. Everyone wants to set goals, so should you too? But you need to understand that living too much in the future will damage your chances of testing and relaxing. As such, it's critical that you set strategic goals for the long future, say like ten years.

My mother instilled this phrase in me when I was a child: "A job is almost complete when you know what you want, it becomes complete when you do the job". Once you find the one thing that you are passionate about, achieving it will not be a herculean task. You will not need to force yourself to do it; you will wake up feeling refreshed and ready to do everything required to do what needs to be done to achieve your goals. So, it's safe to conclude that the hardest part is discovering what you want. Once you have identified what you want, the rest is simple. The actual job isn't difficult. Once the goals you have marked for yourself, you will be hungry to work towards the realization of the goals every time, you will have energy and you will wake up knowing what to do. Writing down your objectives will give you an understanding of what you truly want, and also help you stay focused on things that are important to you.

Also, you need to be mindful of the choices you make. Your choices will either take you towards your goal or take you away from it. You also need to understand that each choice you make will lead to another choice, so it's important that you make choices that are in accordance with your values. I argue that when you believe in something, you can achieve it as long as to take the necessary steps towards it. So, it's important that when you set out to achieve a goal, you should also believe in yourself that you can achieve it.


### Time

Remember I talked about you having a calendar and a to-do-list? Time creates a sense of urgency to achieve all you have on your calendar and to-do-list. We all can keep ourselves busy, but in reality, it's about how much time we spend to create value. It's important that you chunk your time so you can make maximum use of it. Chunking your time shows you the actual picture of how you are managing your time. It isn't about how hard you work, but how much time you expend to get where you want. As such, it's important that you spend your time wisely.

I advise that you spend the first 90 minutes of your time to focus on the important task because that's the time you have the most strength and willpower.


### Love

The most potent meditation is sending love. Having tried different types of meditation, I discovered that sending love speeds up the process of meditation and energizes you. Now, sending love to someone requires you to be in a state of peace.  This exercise will change who you are and, after a while, you will feel like someone is touching your lobe or your forehead. Don't get overhyped with third eye spirituality, as it's a neurological process, but who knows, maybe I am wrong. My assumption is that your pineal gland, which regulates circadian rhythm is the one showing itself by releasing the neurotransmitters such as serotonin and melatonin that makes the experience a visual one.

Here are some ways to send love: I am sending love to all my friends. I am sending love to my partner in life a friend who does everything she can to make us united. I am grateful for sending love to her and for being able to be a man I wish I can be. I am grateful for being a man that creates a family and develops a unit of life. I am sending love to the manufacturers of my fantastic smartphone.

You need to understand that there are different levels of love as love has different potencies. Here is my understanding of the levels of love one can have towards something:

 1. Baby love hedonistic.

 2. Expectational love

 3. Unconditional love

 4. Sacrificing love even when it hurts.

Ask yourself the level of love where you gravitate the most and the level of love you seek and live in the most. If you desire to be happy, you need to be in level 4. This level of love will give you true happiness when you can infinitely give to someone

Sending love will teach you how to love and to love people around you even when they couldn't. Love is the strongest power!



### Regarding meditation in general

The pineal gland is highly active when you are grateful and this activeness calms your body. There are different ways to meditate and I implore you to explore them all. Each person responds to the types of meditation differently, that is, the type of meditation that worked for me may not work for you. One of the important benefits of meditation is that it makes us more human. Studies have shown that the act of meditation helps to disengage the stress center of the brain. So, it's safe to say that meditation reduces stress and pain and also makes one confident. What's more? Meditation also helps to build the frontal cortex responsible for control of emotions, language and logic. Dedicating a few minutes a day to meditate is enough, remember that you are not competing with anyone. You have to learn and evolve!

The crucial part of meditation is the lowering of brain waves by concentrating on the third eye or the pineal gland. This can be easily done wherever you are, be it on a plane, in a queue or on a bus. Meditation controls your emotions by lowering brain waves; and when your brain waves is lowered, you become more proactive and less impulsive. So it's safe to conclude that meditation gives you the power to control yourself.


### NoFap

The idea that pleasure is stimulated and not real shouldn't appeal to a healthy person who respects him or herself. With ideas of Nofap, it comes with the same as any other neuro stimulation that will lead to a trigger from dopamine receptors that can lead to the overdose and dependency, which will lead to focusing your energy to the direction which doesn't produce anything great for yourself. If you love yourself, use your energy towards something that you want; that's why I've added it to the goals. As goals can only be achieved by a person who uses energy right. With NoFap, I don't recommend obstructing yourself from sex as I truly believe that it's a beautiful experience and should be experienced often, with a healthy mind of course.


### Story of No pleasure, no struggle.

Imagine the future where every person can have any information anytime, anywhere, and when you can do anything anywhere by just telling your artificial intelligence what you want. Imagine the future where all of that is taken away from you. Is that the future you want? Now are you ready to live? Are you

### Genetic approach

In order to fully develop, you have to work with your epigenetic. We are the walking genetic expressions that over time set the stone from epigenetic expression in our body to pass to our children! Being objective here is important! The body wants to express its genes and you are a walking expression of your genes and that's how you should see yourself. Your decision that was made on your state, value system and awareness made you do something and that gave a signal for that gene to trigger. Now if you develop the lifestyle that triggers the genes, you will also need to develop the lifestyle you want and for that you will need to understand what you need to do to become who you want. Gene expression is like a biological value system and have a deep awareness of yourself as a piece of the puzzle of this infinite world. Make sure you control your state by creating the rituals that resonate with you. It's possible that all the stuff that I've mentioned here are not relevant; possibly they are but being aware of your state is effective as you have the power to control it and change at your own will and not on stimuli you have on the outside. You will only start seeing results in life when you learn to control yourself. For self-awareness, all you need to do is to create rituals that trains your awareness and one of the ritual is meditation. Meditation quickens the area of the brain that can think about itself and makes it more prevalent than other parts of the brain.

### Bonus tips and tricks

#### Breaking down the goal, plan and the map

While some set 10 years to achieve their goals, others set daily or weekly goals. Regardless of the time you set to achieve your goals, you need to be aware of the map and the plan if you are keen on achieving on goals. Both plan and map are important as they put your focus on the goals at hand, remember, plans can be overwritten by the constant changes in the environment. One of the issues that arises when it comes to setting goal is keeping them at a high level. We all desire to accomplish great things in life, but if we do not break our goals down into chunks, it might be difficult to achieve them. The convenient way to achieve the important goals that you have penned down for yourself is breaking down the goals into smaller ones. Have a long term goal, medium term goal and short term goals. When you break down your goals, you find it relatively easy to work towards the realization of your goals. As such, the best way to get to your destination is to have a mix of short, medium and long term goals. When you break down your goals, it's much easy to work towards because you know what to do in steps. Remember, no one can eat an elephant in one sitting. Take it a day at a time.


#### Accountability

Have friends that you are accountable to. Having friends that you are accountable to will help you get far with your goal. I call it an “Accountability buddy” who will help you make giant strides in your goals. However, you need to find someone that you can rely on and will be committed to you. Likewise, you need someone that you respect enough to listen to when he pushes you. Your accountability buddy will remind you to stay on track when you get distracted. Your accountability buddy could be your friend or a family member. Make them punish you if you do not achieve your goal in time. The punishment can be a bet.  You can set a bet on money; if you lose money, you will more than likely work hard to achieve your goal. Having a journal on a daily basis can remind you to do it continuously as well.


#### Music

Choose your song playlist wisely as this has an effect on your state of mind. So when you choose your tracks, you want to be sure that they are positive and can benefit you and make you grow. Music helps to improve brain function and health in many ways. Good music makes you happier, productive and smarter. More importantly, music helps to reduce stress and also improve your mood. Listening to music helps to reduce chronic stress by reducing the production of the stress hormone cortisol. Furthermore, music makes you powerful, hopeful and have control of your life. If you are having a bad day or you find yourself in a bad situation, listen to music. Good music has a way of healing you.

What's more? Music helps to boost the chemicals in the brain. Music affects our mood by inducing the production of certain chemicals in the brain. Listening to music helps to increase the production of neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical in the brain responsible for the feel good pleasure that comes from having an orgasm and eating chocolate. You can further increase dopamine production by listening to an organized and shuffled Playlist. When a favorite song comes up unexpectedly, the result is a rapid dopamine boost.

Also, music helps to stimulate the production of the brain hormone oxytocin. Oxytocin is referred to as the moral or trust molecule as it instills trust and helps us bond more with others. Science has shown that oxytocin bump experienced by lovers of music can make them trustworthy and generous.


#### Kill the fear

This part focuses on eliminating the fears that stop you. Here, your weaknesses will start to pop out, and you will see how to overcome them. The only thing that can stop you is yourself. When you realize that you can achieve anything as long as you are focused, you will move on with high speed. Close your eyes and imagine yourself reaching your objectives and every step in between, so by the time it appears, your brain doesn't negotiate with setbacks. Instead, your brain deals with it.

Take for Example: The fear center of your brain is scared of how the meeting will turn out. What can you do? Instead of worrying about how the meeting the turn out, why not imagine the person you are meeting with loving your presentation and asking more questions about your interests?


#### Have a wallpaper

To remind yourself throughout the day, have your wallpaper on the phone with your affirmation, your goals, and your writings of who you are. To write who you are, make sure that you write it in a format of "I am who I am," so your subconscious mind doesn't resist but think of it as facts.


#### Compare how you lived

You really start to live when you face death, when you know your time is limited and there is an urgency to do something of much importance to you. Ask yourself as an exercise; if this is the last day of your life, what will you do? This will help to explore your head, your needs, your emotion, and what you love. This brings motivation to you! To intensify the life, compare how you lived a life before you die in the future and compare how you live now. If the life you lived surrounds what you strive for, then it's great.



### Yoga

The aim of yoga is to relax the whole body and clear the mind, making sure that the brain works less and relax as a form of meditation.  After testing the brain waves response to yoga I can say that it can be as potent as meditation if done right.

#### The flow state

The flow state comes when you don't engage in criticism and just do what you have to do. Our ideas of flow has been broken down as a result of constant self-criticism which leads to the ideas that create the negative self image. Live a life full of joy!  Live a life where you do what you want to do and you will create the life that you desire. Effortless ideas of growth and understanding will lead to the flow state where you are giving yourself to others and living in sync with the world.

#### Ask a question ?

A good question leads to a great answer; Great answers lead to great decisions, and Great decisions lead to a great life. I've gone through different types of questions to make sure that my brain works on them over the years to come. How can I make this book more valuable to the person who is reading it? How can I find, experiment and test more information on a specific topic? How can I structure the book in a way that makes it easier to understand! Which other fields of science does this activity touch? These are the questions I've asked myself to make sure that everything can be easier for the reader to understand!


####Password for your goals

Set a password on your devices that remind you of your goal. For example; Write a music album before the end of the year, Write the book before the end of 4th of September, Sell x amount of glasses before the end of the year.

#### Pain and Pleasure.

If you think of the way we are built as humans, you will find that we constantly try to run away from pain and seek pleasure. If you find that working towards your goals comes with pain, there is a need for you to rewire your idea of pain and make your body do what needs to be done.

One of my favorite phrases is when you say yes - you say no many times, and when you say no, you say yes many times.

Your goals are your journey; therefore, your genetic destiny is based on your goals as they shape you and make you into who you are.

Make your goals stay with you more conveniently than anything else. Everything is fighting for your convenience, the businesses that sell you goods, friends who love you, and your family makes convenience for your effort to be achieved. Don't make your life hard for yourself, you don't need that to get what you want.

#### Define the needs of the market

When it comes down to value creation, we all need to understand that market pays us to produce value, and it doesn't care about many aspects that people are setting as a priority which could be gear, person and location.  The market doesn't care if you are working from office or from home, if you use a laptop or a phone.

#### Do what you love

If you do what you like and that matches with what the market needs, you ultimately get happier and more valuable over time. Sometime in the beginning, it’s hard to catch up, and you have to deliver the skill set. Even if you are doing what you love, you still need to get good at it. Your energy comes from passion and skill comes from experience.  Combine these factors and watch yourself get results fast. Also, you have to bring yourself where you learn and pursue things you are not good at. Even if you die without getting an economical reward, you will be happy as a person. Besides doing what you are re good at, I advise you to learn stuffs you are not good at as well. Learn fast so you can have the required skills and energy that brings enormous value and at the end, you will become valuable as a leader, artist, entrepreneur whichever you choose.

#### Thinking squared

The neocortex is the only brain that is able to think about itself. I recommend reflecting on your thinking. When you think of what you are you thinking, will start to filter out things that are detrimental to you as you will be aware of yourself.

To speed up meditation, I will recommend you to check out

Binaural beats: The tradeoffs with binaural beats is that you change your state with the environment and you can ask yourself a philosophical question, do you want to be in a meditative state when you drive or run away from danger. Binaural beats can be a great introduction to meditation with the feelings and relaxations, but over practicing it will do more harm than good, you should train yourself to get to those states without help.

Detox: Detox yourself, as this will help your brain send more electrical current through the brain and rewire itself quicker.

Explore: Explore different types of meditation as different people have different preferences. For some, it's playing guitar, yoga, music, dancing, sitting cross-legged and figuring how to slow down the brain to become more observant.

### y four funky meditations.

1. Meditate on the highest note that you can reach: This is great for singers. It worked on my body but I didn’t test other people. Sit and hear the highest note in your body and elevate it to the point where your brain wouldn't recognize the notes.

2. Mediation from the moon: When I look at a watch, it reminds me of the moon, and I walk and meditate when in a rush to make sure that I come to the meetings. I am in a state that is primed and calm

3. Focus make - I am saying or thinking focus as an object in my head and then I produce    branches of information in search of life and meaning

4. I am grateful for all I have and people that surrounds me. Just say that over and over to get into a state and do feel it deep.

As humans, we need varieties and we need varieties of the things we want, not varieties of problems though problems make us tougher. Overtime, you will deal with problems with ease and that will make you more significant. We need to work on our conscience to have a great experience, and we want to love and connect with people on a very deep level to really understand the problems that needs solving. This is very important as it helps with internal growth, and will help you to contribute and help others. Change your emotions, as it help changes your motion and your direction.

Use the time when your body is lazy to think and plan, and when you are full of energy, then execute. You will figure out your body. Awareness is the key at the end of the day. You can change yourself if you can measure the change, and before the measurement comes the awareness of what needs to be changed.

To conclude the ‘I GOT Love journal’, meditation and plan will change your emotional state, so you become emotionally fit to tackle obstacle while taking away the pain from the past, so ensure that nothing slows you down.


###  Story of Evolving loop

We are in this constant loop that evolves and will evolve. You get, you gain, you are bored, you seek, you get, you gain, you are bored you seek, you get, you gain, you are bored, and you seek. The person who is dumb and doomed is the person who never changes their mind.

Measuring the state technique mind-body feedback loop.

The way I adopted to measure my state: Over the years, I've developed this thing I refer to as Halo. I thought Halo was dope; I felt a circle shaped thing flying above my head, especially when I am in deep meditation. I look at all the religious paintings and seeing the angels with the halo drawn on them. I was like wow, this is awesome. I am the angel just kidding I think it’s something that all of us capable of achieving although a friend of mine was telling me he was feeling horns from sides of his skull so who knows.  Well my curiosity killed my joy quicker than I expected. I didn't try to reach the feeling of having a halo, I just felt it when meditating for a long period of time and especially when I was meditating with the intention of sending love to someone while being in a state of gratitude. After researching with the ideas of religions of halo, I've bumped into ideas of aura and started to ask myself what does it mean? Magnetic field ideas start to pop out as halo started to get larger and get around my body. When it started to get larger and larger, it freaked me out, remember I said that I believe that we are expanding things using an old language. I think new ones should be made for this to explain maybe it is quantum physics or religion. At this stage, what I know is I feel awesome when I meditate and feel halo. I assess the state and I start playing around with it all the time and I want to get more people feeling as I did help few of my friends to get to the state when they were feeling like a pulsation, or massage on their head and in many cases it’s different as mentioned before

I know it's weird, and after my research and figuring out why there is feeling, I've feel that it's nothing more than a mechanism that displays in which state you are in and how you are connected to the environment - as animals are connected, so as you within a group. If it's getting larger then your body goes outward, and you are connecting with nature and absorbing and searching, if it's inside and close to your skin as in yogi people call crown chakra than you are more centered, then you are inside an internal world and in less of exploration and more stable. I know it sounds like pseudoscience, even I am looking at this and thinking what the F.... But after experiencing those things many time, I found that life isn't the same and I think it wouldn’t be for you either. I call it a magnetic field and the top of the head like a dot or halo depending on how I want to see it.

Getting to this state of self-awareness, and making sure you are in control of your states and magnetic fields requires you to explore outside. We will explore how to get to the state where you can feel it as I've experimented and I am trying to cover as much as possible to make sure that people will feel it.

When you are not taking steps to grow yourself, you are going on a negative downward spiral as the world moves forward. I say, at least do observe.

Once I was super drunk, enjoying the time with my friends and I made a toast! A toast for our parents! Saying that we as individuals don't have to put so many calories of energy to get the results. I was drinking and I was drunk that time but the idea that we create our life and we should find an easier way so we don't use up resources. We also need to make sure that we are self-disciplined and can do the work! Here, we are going to discuss the tricks, habits and tradeoffs of what it takes to do what you want. Also, we will discuss how to charge yourself so you have more energy and therefore can tackle the obstacles and how to conserve energy so you don't use it up.

### Meditation and awareness
When you see a power plant, it's aware of what happens inside of it. It feels and senses everything that is inside. In order for it to work and adjust, it has to be first aware of itself and what comes in and out. Human beings do that unconsciously but knowingly. Now being aware of your body will help you understand and reassess your environment.

When a general sits on top of the hill, he sees the whole army and the opponent, and decides where to move the army to defeat the opponent. Information overload is happening in our brain. Every piece of information is the information that helps us to survive, and now we are making and consuming more and more information. Regarding the information overload; now our brain hasn't evolved as fast as information produced, but the amount of information that is given to us is extreme. Add few days of silence and less contact, and let the brain figure out things. Days of silence allows you to process things out. The less stimuli your brain has to deal with throughout the day, the less things it will process. Imagine you have a cup, and you pour in water all the time, and when you overfill it, the water will spill. But the brain tries to accommodate that water and increase in size and speed itself up. Now if you pour in less water, you will free your mind. The great practice is meditation but few days of meditation is one of the most effective, and being in silence is super effective. This will help so much drastically, and when you come back, you will change your priorities and therefore, actions, as your brain now knows what is more important.

Mindfulness is all about paying attention to what is now without allowing things control you. There's a space between stimulation and response and you will only be able to widen the space with meditation. You want to be sure that you are not reacting but observing and deciding how to respond. The way we respond makes our destiny.

You need to have an understanding of the default mode network where you slow down your brainwave activity and not respond when your body wants to. The music and all those convenient additions are good, but they are also taking you away from the truth, the truth is that our brain is the value management system with the priority set for survival and for growth as secondary.

The more we unconsciously allow our attention to be directed and redirected, the less aware we become of the fact that it is happening. The existential crisis comes from the ideas that we as human beings need to survive and grow and we are doing this sort of a/b testing on that and we are getting A/B tested by the planet. The idea that mind and philosophy interconnect with the value system and doing something that is important is more valuable than wasting time and that’s why our actions are really designed to be evolutionary even if it’s sedative. Now we have connected to people on so many different levels. The life is more about the stuff that we do and the ideas that make the world a better place around us and therefor the environment that we shape is also an expression of who we are.

The brain will rewire its structures when you meditate and it will reprioritize things that are more important! The brain is a value sorter and you have to sort out your priorities.

Meditation helps to build your brain and change your value system.  Changing value system will let go of all the stuff that is not connected to you and free up the space for things that are important. Then, it builds up the brain to think outside the box and be more aware of the world.


### Distractions

Oftentimes, we are distracted from the things that are more important to us. We can solve the problem of distraction by first having an understanding of the things that are valuable to us. On a daily basis, ask yourself for the things that are more valuable to you, to the world and to your future, then project yourself towards the things.


### Activating the glands.

To activate your pituitary gland, simply focus on the point between your eyebrows as it helps to stimulate the growth hormone.

Find your strength and make your strength even better with time. When you do something important quickly, you tend to outrun the value creation environment that seeks to add more value on the planet. So, while meditating you will bring your focus back to the reality and the state to flow more and more. You should know that the overabundance of information brings about distortion of focus. So when you distract yourself with a truckload of information you don't need, you are simply wasting your time. Stimulate your brain to constantly search for useful information; this will help your brain evolve, grow, survive and procreate. Try not to sprinkle your brain with useless information, otherwise you'd just be wasting your life away.


### Understanding the field - aura
Now I know this will sound a lot like pseudoscience but listen to me and you will understand what I'm trying to say.

Two atoms form an element; few elements form a molecule, few molecules form a cell, many cells form an organ, many organs form a body, many bodies form a group, and many groups come together to form civilization. Now we need to understand the concept of an energy field where the field is the information exchange tool. The monks and many people who are in spiritual realms start to feel it as they are increasing their awareness of themselves and so they were drawing it in the paintings and calling it auras. The field will be charged with more positive emotions as more neurons will be created. Now it's hard to grasp the concept before feeling the field but stay with me. Now if you have no energy in the cell, what will happen? They will dissipate into atoms, and same comes from the body. The body will dissipate into particles and cells for nature to recycle it. The body needs to keep this field charged to be healthy. Meditation will train you to be more aware of it, and with time, you will know what needs to be done which may be engaging in breathing techniques to charge it, having a different diet and changing your perspective of life. The charge of the field applies to many things, but mainly, it will keep you going for longer, which will give you an extra step ahead when the rest are resting. The field is charged through the process of movement of spinal fluids, which are full of salts. That creates the field, and as it goes up in around 12 hours and down in 12 hours. This process can be hastened with breathing as well as the creation of electric current from the brain that comes from mechanic to electric. By exerting pressure on the crystals of a pineal gland you generate electricity and the magnetic field.

The pineal gland, otherwise known as third eye is an electric generator for the body, and the way the spinal liquid moves up our spine, it turns the mechanical movement into electric which in turn creates the electricity.   The property of the pineal gland and its expansion allows the magnetic field to be made - some call it aura - but I call it the magnetic field. The magnetic field helps you to make the connection with the environment and turn you into a gamma brain wave producing machine that feels super excited, which processes the information and place the valuable information above all, as you have the brainpower to process and create the information architecture inside it.

Meditation makes you a spiritual monster which controls itself and therefore whatever you want. The more you meditate, the better. The more you are grateful for life, the more charged you are. The more charged you are, the more you will be in gamma waves when you meditate very deeply. The more you are in gamma waves through life, the more the opportunities will come about as you will be more receptive to them. The more charged your inner world is, the more you influence the outer world as it will reflect who you are.

The strength of the individual is relative to the magnetic field. When you have abundance of electric current in your brain, then you will have more available electrical energy to use to pass the signal and allow the brain to work on delivering information to the body. Just like a magnet, the body has North and south poles.

To do something, you have to be driven to do it, and when you are in control of your emotions, you can control your actions, and that will bring the results.

DMT is a great tool that helps to rearrange the brains neuron connection. What happens when you escape a near death experience? You feel euphoric like your brain is controlling your life. This is the reason why I recommend mediation, breathing, exercise and other activities to stimulate the growth of your brain.


### Why worry?

Why worry when there's a way out? Do you have a problem? Is there a solution? Why worry if there is a solution to your problems? Instead of spending your time worrying, consider looking at the positive and finding a solution. Cortisol, Testosterone and estrogen are all made from the same building blocks and can be depleted by stress and worry, so you want to be mindful of stress and worry. Decide how you respond to external stimuli and you will have a handle or edge over stress.

### A session with hypnotherapists and fortunetellers.

Having a session with fortune tellers help to lower your brainwaves, places you in a state of trance and sends information to your brain in a format that makes you digest it deeply. The same also applies to hypnotherapy.

### Watching TV

 Alpha waves are more present in your brain, and so you are more suggestible to information. Now instead of watching TV, I would like to ask you to create the movie of your future. And while at it, increase your magnetic field and change your genetic code by elevating your emotions.

### Living in the moment.

Human beings have an idea of living in the moment, but if you ask me, I'd say living in the moment is a weird concept. We have a functioning brain that does the cognitive function of planning and going over memories to analyze them and see how we could have done things better in the past and how to do it better in the future.

 We collect data from the past to essentially make better decisions in the future. Some people have problems with cerebral activity and over-attachment to the time that they live, which they call now. Since we have a super computer like the brain, we need to read the manual, and we shouldn't dull the mind on thinking on just reactionary activities. Because we understand what happened in the past, we can make sure to avoid painful experiences and grow while focusing on things that develop us. All human experience is based on chemistry and the business of the endocrine response. Having the chemistry of blissfulness, no matter what, allows you to grow and to be strong. What you can do in this world and what you can't do is based on psychology and information management as you change the world, but the world will always be there.

The idea of living in the moment is obsolete as you can't live in the other times yet, maybe quantum physicists will prove me wrong. It took a lot of time to figure out what to do in the future or remember, and now the philosophy jumps into this idea of do this and not that.

### Dream journal

Our brain is an organ that we do not fully understand. We do not fully understand dreams, but writing a journal helps in analyzing the meaning. I have had many answers that came through in my dreams. Edison said to never go to bed without asking your subconscious to work. Your subconscious works with emotions, so make sure you focus your emotions before sleeping as well.

"The value of a character is based on how many uncomfortable acts were done to achieve virtue". - Andranik @focusmake

"Instead of searching for love, be the love" - Andranik @focusmake

"Before knowledge was power. Now knowing what to ignore is power. Now having a right value system is more important than anything else". Andranik @focusmake

Meditation allows us to reprogram our subconscious by changing values to the things that we are isolating. It is controlling itself through feedback loops, and changes your automatic response to situations. Andranik @focusmake
