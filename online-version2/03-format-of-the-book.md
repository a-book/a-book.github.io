## FORMAT OF THE BOOK
This book is a guide that is systematically written and arranged chronologically to extract value from each action and expand the next one. Each step is explanatory with detailed hows and whys as well as the benefits of the steps and how it turns your life around.

This book is all about giving your ideas and information that will help you to form new habits, paradigms and also focus on the things that are important to you. Developing new habits that align with your vision helps you to support your dreams and bring them to fulfillment. This book presents a lot of rituals, and I made sure that I explained the fundamentals of these rituals, why you should do them, the basics, what to do and the values and benefits of the rituals.

Note that this book is not all about habits. I didn't write this book for you to behave like animals that do the same thing over and over again. No! I wrote this book for you to learn and spice up your life. I wrote this book for you to equip yourself better and learn different fields. I wrote this book for you to have information in abundance.

### Who are we?

As humans, we function as rockets. We gear up every day, fuel ourselves, start the ignition and fly to our destination. We make sure not to repeat the mistakes we made in the past, we learn from the decisions we made in the past. We resolve to do something new each day to become the better version of ourselves, then we land and rest to continue the following day and the following day.

### Regarding the sources

As I mentioned earlier, this book is based on my personal experiences. I didn't copy or rephrase the contents of a textbook; it is all a product of my experiences.

I will warn you that this knowledge will give you the understanding that will most likely change your perception of spirituality and religion. I implore you to come with an open heart and try not to question the book until you finish reading. By then, you would have an understanding of the science and chronology behind the book. Not every advice in the book will work for you, after all, we all have different minds and bodies.

### What I dislike about the education system

My biggest concern about the education system is that the system grades education on one's value. Every person is different and have their talent and predisposition based on genetics, chance and persons environment. That is, everyone is an expert in their chosen field. What education system does is to tell different people to do the same thing and then mark them using one criterion. We should teach our kids to explore, figure out stuff, be independent and enjoy life.

The constant feedback loop of gaining self-knowledge and experimentation allows you to understand more about nature and more of yourself. I'm bothered that we have an amazing tool (brain) that we really do not know how to operate it and fully maximize its functions without getting ourselves burned.

Because I want you to read this book to the end, I'll teach you a trick to speed your reading by 200%.

###  How to speed your reading

At the beginning of this book, I mentioned that some of the advice written in this book could hurt you. You read the warning slowly, and now you need to speed up your reading to make better use of the book. I want to give you a trick that will speed up your reading twice as faster. I implore you to carry out this speed reading exercise because, at the end of the exercise, you will have a brain that works faster. Also, the exercise will heighten your awareness and improve your sensors.

Now, we want to do three important things.

### 1. Increase speed so your eyes can grab information faster. This only happens when you read faster. Now the question is, how do you achieve this?

Try to read as fast as you can and train your eyes to move quickly. Place your finger and move very fast such that you can barely catch up with comprehension of the content.  Take for instance: You are driving at a distance of 160 miles per hour, then you slow down to 50 miles suddenly. At 50 miles, you observe the tiniest details on the road. You can start to pick out not just the colors of the grass but the colors of leaves and even the number plates of all the cars that drive on the other side! Your shifted your brain and told it to work faster, so the comprehensions comes from that. Even though your brain loves the abundance of information, you still need to drive faster. How do you drive faster and at the same time observe the tiniest details? How do you drive faster and at the same time increase your awareness? Now let's relate this to a book; how do you read faster and at the same time grab the information contained in the book?

### 2. Widen the field through peripheral vision which in turn widens the visual awareness as a whole.

Grab a finger or a pen and close all lines below to help you focus. Now try reading few words at once. You will develop a peripheral vision which will help you see more information in a shorter period of time. The speed will come in a bit. What you need to do is to speed your brain and improve your comprehension at the same time.  Some people also recommend switching off the internal voice when reading as it helps to push the reading speed further.

### 3. Improve comprehension by clearing your head or by making sure that you are reading something that interests you. You have to be picky with the information!

How do you rid your head of unnecessary thoughts?  Change your priorities and your focus will shift! When you change your priorities and you focus on what you want to achieve at that moment that sends a message to your subconscious that you love yourself than waste time on frivolities.

### 4 Sub-conscious reading.

The way I read is different to many people. I read the night before I go to bed for 5-10 minutes to get the book into subconscious and the next day I wake up and I read consciously. The reading experience is meant to work this way I believe. First you feel the information and that you structure it not receive and structure in smaller chunks as it takes longer due to focus shifting. Subconscious reading is the reading where you set your eyes to open the peripheral vision and when you read with eyes at center you just swipe the pages. You must be able to see two line instead of one line division between pages and that way you know youâ€™ve activated the peripheral vision.

The idea comes in as well that you make the information part of you before being aware of it. The subconscious mind is like a quantum computer it's everywhere it's sees all. The brain picks up that ideas and makes it part of you without you even realizing and doing a next day filtering of information makes sure that you consciously influence the subconscious and that makes it super interesting as you are able to make new connections and restructure your brain quicker.
