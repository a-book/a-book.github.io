## MAP 10 - SLEEP

Sleep is super important, and I can't say how long you should sleep as there are tradeoffs involved. Moreover, you need a long sleep when you've been beating your body in the gym for too long. What we can do is to speed up sleep, making sure that biological processes work faster, and that we go sleeping happily without anything bothering us, so we sleep deeper. Now we will consider the biological and psychological needs for sleep, and how to improve them.

### Detox your brain

Imagine this! Your brain produces toxins throughout the day, and it needs to get rid of them. Now, imagine how you can speed up this process! You are right to make the flow larger and to provide something that can neutralize the toxins. To clear the pathways through stretching by opening up spinal discs, or in other words, the distance between the spinal discs will open up the path for the toxins to be removed. You can do that by doing the same 4-axis stretch that is similar to the one in step 8, which you do after the workout, that will essentially increase the flow, and so the body can remove the toxins easier. Now to neutralize the toxin, you can alkalize, and to do that effectively, you can drink alkaline water, lemon juices, teas that are not black and are caffeine-free such as chamomile and other herbal teas to make sure that you detox quicker and sleep better.

### Melatonin

When you sleep, melatonin induces the deep sleep - the REM sleep. Melatonin ensures that you fall asleep deeply and also ensures that your hormones align accordingly.

It's important to get plenty of sleep for rewiring as the brain will fire together when you sleep and that will help the brain to grow and develop.

Melatonin is required to make DMT, and will essentially help you to develop the skills that you have in life.

Importance of Melatonin

* Lowers cortisol
* Improves carbohydrate metabolism.
* Stimulates anti-aging.
* Promotes DNA repairs and replication.
* Activates neuroprotective role in the brain.
* Decreases the development of certain tumors.
* Heightens the immune response.
* Inhibits atherosclerosis (hardening arteries).
* Lowers triglyceride levels.
* Increases lifespans of some animals by 20%.

### Increases REM sleep.

Melatonin lowers with age and this is the reason why older people have issues with falling and staying asleep. Melatonin also conflicts with insulin so the more you eat before sleep, the worse the sleep you will have.

### Internal clock and waking up early

Now imagine if you do an exercise every day for a month at 6 am. Your body will know that 6 am is exercise time.  Your body doesn’t know if you are hunting or lifting barbells, it just fixes 6am as exercise time. To make your workout better and effective, your body will produce hormones that will make the exercise more rewarding and less damaging.

 You have to understand that the internal clock part is also a self-awareness tool. When you set your action in time, your brain and fluids and hormones will work in that patterns. Your body will prepare set of hormones to kick in when you wake up, if you start your day with exercise. Studies have shown that the body makes energy available when you do something at a specific time. It would help you and help others to live much fuller lives if people understood this concept than they will have much deeper sleeps which spills on other things in life. .

### Stretch for faster sleep

One of the main functions of sleeping is clearing out toxins in the brain.  You can speed up this process by stretching your back as spinal disks will give more space for spinal fluids to move around. You will sleep much deeper, and your body will recover quicker if you do that.

### Sleep at the same time

The reason to go to sleep at the same time is to make sure that your body knows when are you sleeping and, therefore, prepare the internal chemistry. The pineal gland, which regulates the circadian rhythm. It regulates the hormones to perform better next time, while using less energy through the cycles of the day.

The reason to go to sleep at 10 pm and sleep until at least 2-3 am is to get your body to produce growth hormones to rejuvenate your body and also increase the alkalinity. Have you ever wondered why you looked skinnier in the mirror when you wake up? That's one of the reasons. If it's hard to sleep at those hours, at least try to sleep at the same time. Breaking your sleeping schedule can produce cortisol, which will stress you up, and cause you to gain fat, lose muscle, and lose the brainpower. The melatonin is abundant between 1 and 4 am, so that will help you with recovering quickest.

Now, put your phone in Airplane mode and go to bed at a good time.

### Bonus tricks

Blue light blocking glasses and dim the lights.

Wear the blue-blocking glasses that will make sure that your brain doesn't produce too much serotonin, and that way, you make your brain think it’s night time and not day time.

Now imagine millions of years ago, we were multi-celled creatures that did a range of activities such as digest and hunt. One evolutionary tool that we call pineal gland woke us up when it was sunny, and switched us off when it was dark. Dimming the light will make sure that the pineal gland wouldn't switch on our brain.

Screens and sleep are the enemies of the brain as they produce the serotonin and that disrupts the production of the melatonin because they are in conflict with each other.

### The drink that’ll place you to sleep.

Spoon of apple cider vinegar and spoon of honey mix it in cold water . ( use the straw ) Drink that few minutes before you want to go to bed and see what happens. Just make sure that you are close to bed.

### Make your subconscious work for you

Analyze the day. Every evening, you should write, type, or think of the good and the bad that happened in a day; analyzing them and thinking about what you have learned from it. That way, you can make sure that whatever you do is great work and when that thing happens the next time, you can act differently and not follow the same pattern, breaking the loop if you want to. You can also ask yourself, what did I make? Good work should make you proud, and if you produce work that makes you proud, YOU WILL BE HAPPY. To make sleep more useful, ask questions that bothers you. Analyze the day to figure out the questions that bothers you.

Ask yourself those questions and build emotions around a big question while you can meditate before sleeping. Go to bed while making your subconscious work for you. We truly create when we do with passion. By falling asleep with passion towards something, it will make our brain work extra hard, and will shape your dreams accordantly, which we can use to our advantage. 95% of the brainpower is distributed in the subconscious mind and the rest in the conscious one. This makes the essence of whatever we do with our subconscious mainly. The time that we use for analyzing your subconscious will help us with future decision-making.

### Change your state before you sleep

Today is the best day of my life as it shows that I need to do things in advance and that I need to make sure that my actions are justified.

Write or type why it's the best day of your life in your planner if you want or think about it. Now, being able to convert everything in life into a positivity increases strength and truly helps you evolve. Making sure that you can deal with any situation as you take it as a learning experience. This helps you go forward all the time. Turning anything into positivity changes your mindset and helps you to learn quickly as your brain really can observe when it's in a positive state of mind. When it's in a negative state, it narrows down only on negative things. Now, sleep pressure has been built, and scientifically speaking, adenosine is built on neuron receptors. The brain tells you to go to sleep, and that essentially means to go to bed.

### More Air during sleep

Get an air circulator fan to circulate the air inside the room where you sleep, and that way, you will receive more air inside your room, and you will be more charged when you wake up. Keep house plants if you live in cities.

### Sleep on the left side

There are lots of reasons to sleep on the left side and one of them is better lymphatic movement. It's also easier on the stomach. The next time you sleep on the sofa, make sure to sleep on your left side.

### Reasons to sleep naked

SLEEP NAKED, you will have a better sleep as your body will breathe more. It makes you more connected to your partner closely. Likewise, there is a drop in stress hormone when you sleep naked. During sleep, growth hormone increases, while cortisol decrease, the natural process of breathing through the skin allows the body to have a deeper sleep when naked.

### 5 am club

Do set a mind that wakes you up at 5 am. Then you will wake up at 5 am if you do it with enough willpower without the alarms.

 The vivid dreams and Apple cider vinegar.

Apple cider vinegar will help you get a great rest when you sleep.

A Tablespoon of Apple cider vinegar and honey in hot water is one of the greatest tranquilizers you can get. It helps with the delivery of nutrients and makes sure that whatever you eat has the better effect on you. Having apple cider vinegar can help you have much more visual dreams. Having a lot of apples also helps but consider the tradeoffs when you fast.

If your pineal gland is full of toxins, you will have less vivid dreams as the execution of the gland is diminished.  Having a pineal gland that is clear and active is like having a second person helping you, as you can visualize pretty much everything.
