## MAP 2: MAKE THE BED

Can you remember the many times when your parents nagged and nagged you until you made your bed? You see making your bed in the morning before heading out a pointless task. You only agree to do it when your mom insists that you can leave the house after you have made your bed. You sluggishly go to make your bed while coming up with different reasons why making the bed is a bad idea. You come up with reasons like the bed is going to get messed up again, my bed is pushed against the wall, and it's hard to keep the sheets tucked in.

If you ask me, making the bed doesn't require much time. As a matter of fact, it helps you become disciplined because it ensures that you are doing the same thing over and over again. When you become disciplined, you will discover that you are the one controlling your body, and not the other way. Small wins are very important in life as they challenge us to go for the larger wins. In the same way, making your bed helps to build your self-discipline such that when your body says no, your human brain will say yes.

Make sure you disconnect or switch your phone off and set a reminder. The reminder could be a wallpaper on the wall or the vision board designed on your phone.

This map is especially useful for individuals who are indiscipline as it helps to create the need for them to work on small things to create their dopamine loop.

### What do you stand to gain from making your bed?

A neat apartment? Improved confidence? Discipline? High chance of completing a hard activity? Here are six ways the two-minute task of making your bed in the morning can improve your day and your life.

#### 1. Your room will instantly look cleaner

Your room will instantly look cleaner the moment you make your bed. This is evident in small bedrooms where most of the bedroom space is occupied by the bed. Just because your bedroom is small with no space doesn't mean you should lower your standards. Small things evolve into big things, so develop the habit of making your bed in the morning.

#### 2. Developing good habits

Once you have made the act of making your bed an everyday ritual and habit, you will find that other good habits will come to you naturally. You find yourself dusting everywhere, dirt now becomes a taboo to you, and you now keep your drawers tidy at all times. Soon after, you will extend your good habits to other parts of the house like the lounge room and kitchen. Before you know it, your once rough and untidy house will become the perfect place for a retreat.

#### 3. Feeling of accomplishment

While making your bed in the morning might seem like a small task to bother yourself with, starting your day by making your bed minutes after you wake up gives you a sense of accomplishment. Making your bed in the morning takes just a few minutes of your time, and when you do it, you set a positive tone and mood for yourself throughout the day. Don't you want to start your day on a positive note?

#### 4. Creating a retreat

We all have good days and days I call "one of those days". Everyone will experience the one of those days where you just want to go home to collapse into your mattress and curl up in your sheets. Whenever you experience one of those days, you have comfort knowing that your ready-made bed is waiting for you at home to rest and relax in.

#### 5. Increased productivity

The first thing on your to-do-list for each day should be making your bed. It's a way of putting all the activities and happenings of the previous day behind and clearing the way for the opportunities and activities of the new day. It's no surprise that making your bed in the morning gives you a sense of pride and will also encourage you to take on another task and many others until you are done with your tasks for the day. And at the end of the day, you will find that a simple task that you completed motivated you to complete all other tasks.

#### 6. Reduced stress levels

Are you keen on decluttering your life? You need to start from your bed. A decluttered bed helps to declutter your space. A decluttered space helps to declutter your mind, and a decluttered mind makes for a decluttered life.

How do you feel whenever you clean out a rough drawer or an untidy closet? You feel an incredible rush of accomplishment and satisfaction yeah? If cleaning out a drawer or closet and making your bed can give you peace and satisfaction, how much more when you clean out the clutter in your life? Clutter stands for things you don't use, things you don't like or need. According to the Feng Shui philosophy, free energy bring about love, wealth, abundance and health for the individuals who absorbs it. Now, clutters has a way of stopping the energy glow thereby creating exhaustion, exasperation and stagnation. Imagine how your life will turn out with negative and stagnant energy around you. But when you address these clutters and create a path for free flow of energy, your life will soon turn around and open up. The more clutter you remove from your life the better you will feel

Here are some things that happens when you address your clutters:

#### You have more time

When the mess in your home or office isn't making you overwhelmed, you will definitely have adequate time to get work done. Not spending an hour combing through your closet for an outfit to wear or searching for your car keys saves you ample time. Addressing your clutters avails you more time to get work done.

#### You become more magnetic and vibrant

The moment you create harmony and order in your home and life, you will find yourself more radiant and present. Clearing clutters is somewhat similar to acupuncture; just as acupuncture removes imbalances and blockages from the body, addressing clutters removes imbalances and blocks from your life and space.

#### Positive risks aren't scary

Clutters often stands for unfinished business, so when you address the clutter, you are giving yourself bigger and creative risk since you are no longer held down by the problems and disappointments of the past.

#### Problems get solved.

When you have a fresh and new perspective about life, you have a clear space that allows you to concentrate and solve problems brilliantly.

#### Money comes freely

When you address your clutter, you will find money in places you don't expect.

#### Sleep becomes deeper

When you address the clutter around you, especially the big storage you hid under your bed, you will find it relatively easy to fall asleep. The more energy that flows freely around you, the easier it becomes for you to relax with a deep sleep.
