MAP 4: POWER OF LIQUID
After a long night of sleep, the body requires water. Infusing lemon in your water is one of the ways to give your morning drink an extra benefit. It's important to note that lemon is alkaline in nature on the inside and acidic on the outside. So, drink with a straw and make sure you brush your teeth before your lemon infused water as brushing can cause damage to your teeth same applies to apple cider vinegar. Now, the common factor about the western diet is that majority of the food constituents are highly acidic and as such, they stress the body. Take for instance; coffee is highly acidic so as much as you love taking coffee, it's expedient that you replace coffee with green tea to be on the safe side. I have a list of ingredients you can mix and drink for breakfast to live longer and have less stress.

These ingredients provides the body with much benefits and you can mix then however you want.

Apple cider vinegar.

Apple cider vinegar helps to reduce your insulin. If you want to stay lean and young for a long time, then there is a need for you to reduce your insulin. One of the food ingredients that increases insulin level is sugar. Now, what you want to do is to make sure your insulin level doesn't rise. To get apple cider vinegar into your system, mix with liquid and drink up. You can also mix it with lemon juice and take it cold or warm. Whichever way you want it. I advise that you take a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before going to bed and first thing in the morning. Also, you can take one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar after your meal for easy digestion. Apple cider vinegar keeps you healthy, promotes weight loss and also increase your growth hormone indirectly. Be sure to buy an organic one.

Furthermore, Apple cider vinegar produces healthy flora in the gut which in turn reduces stress hormone production. Apple cider vinegar also helps the liver process cholesterol. It will interest you to know that Apple cider vinegar is a cure for halitosis; an overabundance of bacteria on the tongue that causes bad breath. More importantly, apple cider vinegar helps to reduce blood sugar. You'd agree with me that high blood sugar is a leading cause of insomnia and high blood sugar prevents the body from burning fat. Apple cider vinegar increases insulin sensitivity thereby lowering blood sugar. Taking a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before sleeping helps you sleep better at night. The body produces growth hormone when you sleep, so you want to be sure that your blood sugar is low as high blood sugar conflicts with growth hormone. Also, Apple cider vinegar is a cure for sore throat as it helps to kill the bacteria in the throat. Apple cider vinegar helps to boost potassium absorption in the body thereby providing balance for the body. Apple cider vinegar helps to lower the amount of gas and also relieve upset stomach. Apple cider vinegar is one of the super remedies that strengthen the immune system of the body and enhance bodily functions. You can also mix apple cider vinegar with honey.

Lemon

Pectin present in lemon helps to aid digestion and ease the digestion of fats. Lemon also helps to rid the body of harmful toxins. It promotes hydration. Lemon is a great source of vitamin C which is a primary antioxidant that protects the cells of the body from damaging free radicals. Also, lemon contains Vitamin C that helps to reduce blood pressure and the risk of developing stroke and cardiovascular disease. What's more? Lemon improves the quality of the skin and also support weight loss.

Ginseng

Ginseng helps to relieve inflammation in the body. Also, ginseng speeds up the healing of wounds and injuries. Ginseng helps in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men. Also, ginseng helps to stimulate mental and physical activity in weak and tired people.


Green tea

Green tea provides the body with much benefits, but the important one is the dopamine that green tea provides. Dopamine helps to calm the body. Also, green tea contains caffeine which keeps you focused.

Coffee

Coffee isn't as gloomy as it appears. You need to understand the tradeoffs before concluding that coffee is a must drink for you. Besides the crashes that coffee does to the body, there are other damaging things that coffee does to the body. For instance, too much coffee causes damage to bone structure. If you must take coffee, I recommend that you take coffee with stevia or sweeteners. Be warned that sugar and sweeteners are bad for the body. Sweeteners do make you addicted to sugars it’s like a fake high you get and when you don’t have sweeteners next to you than you will for sure go for a sugar.

On the bright side, coffee promotes fat loss in the body. Coffee promotes the consumption of fat in the body but at the same time, coffee rids the body of calcium. So, to be on the safe side, balance coffee with a food constituent that has abundance of calcium. Coffee helps to burn more calories in the body. It's safe to conclude that drinking too much coffee will cause you to lose the important minerals the body needs for survival. Also, coffee causes the brain to work faster such that it becomes difficult to focus in the long run. Green tea is a great alternative of coffee, so drink green tea instead.

How to measure if you are acidic

Simply put, Acidic bodies are unhealthy bodies. Acidic bodies creates the environment for yeast, illness and bacteria to thrive. When the body is overly acidic, the body results to loosing minerals from bones and vital organs to neutralize the acid and expel it from the body. As such, the mineral reserves of the body runs low and the body is short of minerals like sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium. The shortage of these minerals in the body causes damages that may not be detected until the body breaks down and develop acidosis.

Many of us have the habit of consuming foods that produces acid such as sugar, meat, grains and dairy. Since the body generates acidic waste products from metabolism, the waste products needs to be excreted or neutralized one way or the other. Now, in order to neutralize the acid generation by the body, we need to consume more alkaline foods (this will be covered later).

Here are some of the health problems that arises from poor pH balance (mild acidosis).

Immune deficiency.
Inflamed cavities and sensitive gums.
Stiff neck, lumbago and sciatica.
Chronic fatigue and low energy.
Coughing, shortness of breath and respiratory problems.
 Yeast fungal overgrowth.
Kidney and bladder infection.
Premature aging.
Cardiovascular damage, as well as oxygen reduction and construction of blood vessels.
Increased heart rate, arrhythmias and heart problems.
Accelerated free radical damage.
Obesity, diabetes and weight gain.
Sleepiness, headache and confusion.
Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Bone spurs, weak brittle bones, osteoporosis and hip fractures.
Acne, allergies.
Aching muscles, joint pain and lactic acid buildup.
Start by knowing your pH

pH testing is critical as it shows an individual the numeric data of the level of acidification in his/her body. The pH reading that is considered healthy ranges from 6.75 to 7.25 while the optimal pH reading is 7.36. It's relatively easy to measure the acidity of your body. Simply get a litmus paper. Pee on the litmus paper or place it on your tongue to measure your acidity. If the test result shows 5.5 and below on the litmus paper, then your body is highly acidic and you need to watch your diet. Drinking the mix of ginger, matcha tea, lemon juice, cinnamon mix and apple cider vinegar in the morning is the best thing you can do for yourself.

The taste of food alone isn't a yardstick to determine if the food is acidic or alkaline

Take for instance; many people believe that lemon is acidic probably because lemon are classified as being acidic. But in the actual sense, lemon is an alkaline forming food. During the digestion process of lemon, the acid in lemon is oxidized into water and carbon dioxide, therefore, lemon do not generate acid in the body system.

However, Sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and iron are the main alkaline materials. Foods that contains high levels of these minerals are considered as alkaline forming foods.

The Body Has Limits

There is a limit to how much the body can allow for acid imbalance. Therefore, it's important that you eat foods that will maintain the acid-alkaline balance of the body. Many illness and diseases arises because the body made attempt to shift the balance of the internal environment. There is a need for you to find the right balance. If your diet includes too much of acid forming foods like sugar, high amounts of meat, dairy and grains, your body will become too acidic. And on the flip side, if you consume too much of alkaline forming foods such as fruits, sea vegetables and greens, your will be overly alkaline. So, balance is key.

The steps to improve your alkalinity

Check your pH on a regular basis.
Stay away from overly acidic foods.
Drink the recommended daily intake of water, alkaline water if possible.
Replace diary milks with almond milk or coconut milk.
Eat a lot of green vegetables.
Stay away from processed foods.
Use collard greens and lettuce leaves as wraps instead of buns.
Eliminate sugars, soda, coffee and replace it with green tea, herbal coffee and herbal tea.
The food you feed your body matters

Though, improving your body's pH levels may require some thought, the rewards cannot be brushed aside. When you find the right acid-alkaline balance, you will appreciate your efforts as you will feel more vibrant, and energetic. In fact, your health will improve generally. There are no objections; what you feed your body has an effect on your overall health. The foods you feed your body can either be the slowest form of poison, that is, what kills you or the powerful and safest form of medicine. Choose wisely.
