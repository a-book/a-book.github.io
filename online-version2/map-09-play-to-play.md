## STEP 9: PLAY TO PLAY

Understand that you need not do anything in this world. You chose to do it and that's why you are doing it. When it comes to relationship, you chose not to manage your relationship with people. You prefer to include them, develop yourself and also develop them. While at it, make sure you stop once in a while to observe where you are coming from, where you are going, and how you can develop yourself.

### What drives you?

It's critical that you take some time to reflect on what you want and why you want to do it. In your soul searching exercise, if you find that what drives you, energizes you and gives you fulfillment, then it's your calling. I wouldn't write a book about how to be a great swimmer because it doesn't interest me and it wouldn't be of a high quality even if I know I can make money out of it.

### The sexual energy to connect

Use your sexual energy to connect with the art and craft. Wars were for love and intentions made. Some might think I am crazy, but the topic of nofap applies here. You will be less complacent when you have this sexual energy in you. Well, I will let you in on this secret; the kettlebell swing helps to increase it so you will have more energy overall to do what you want.

Have you noticed that when you get really close to someone, you start to feel their energy? You feel the energy of those you share your sexual energy with. I'm talking about those you think about this minute and you get a text from them the next minute; those who affects you so much that you can't sleep when they are sick. Those you send food too when you feel they are hungry while in a different country. It's okay to get close to people and feel their energy but you need to be careful. You need to be picky about who you share your sexual energy with as it has a way of shaping your life.

### Confidence to create life.

You need confidence to live a good life; overconfidence makes you arrogant and low confidence makes you fearful so you need to find balance. You can train yourself to have high self-confidence but entertain fear (fear as lack of information not as emotional state) to make sure that you don’t make decisions with the wrong information.  As humans, we tend to interpret the world differently and our interpretation of the world goes a long way to make or break the life we are living as our value system and assumptions comes together to form the decision we make. So be confident in yourself but understand that you will need the right information to make the best assumption and statement for the time that you are living in. Ensure you have the right information before making important decisions.



### The confidence connector

To be confident, you must ask yourself this: why am I doing this? What is the purpose? People show some ways to boost confidence; some of them work, while some of them don't. If you have a great reason and you know there is no danger, then you can do whatever you want.

### If you are shy

To boost your confidence, carry out this exercise: Go to a mall and ask for few phone numbers of an opposite sex. This will get your tongue going and just goofing around to do something silly. Do something silly once in a while, you don't have to be serious every time. I have come to realize that we are different people at different times. We are a living being today but tomorrow, our atoms will pass on to another person and we will dissipate with our awareness disappearing into the cloud.

### Caring Vs Not caring

This applies to everything related to business and life, family and relationship with friends. Let me tell you a story of a king - A king went into a meeting with a rival party and the enemy mentioned that his breath was stinking and so he was insulted. He returned home after the meeting and asked his wife if indeed his breath stinks. The wife replied and said yes he stinks and she thinks that's how men stinks.

The moral of the story is that you can be caring and criticize people constructively at the same time.  You can be caring by saying the truth straight out without holding it back and being frightened that you will insult the concerned person. If you must say things that will hurt someone's ego, make sure you learn how to do it in a way that will make them open to you rather than close up. Your friends and family need you to give them information that will better their life, so if you must criticize, do it constructively.

### What market needs?

What is important is to understand what the market needs; it's not good to become great at something that no one wants. It's important not to multitask as your brain doesn't really do many things at once, it switches from activity to an activity, and it takes around 10 minutes to do so. So make sure that you don’t switch the activity and that you are focused on something that will help you evolve very quickly.

### The synergy

Expand on this. This is a combo of what the market needs and what drives you! If you are doing what you want, and you are getting paid for it, then you are living life. Get out and play on the biggest playground called Earth, and never think of anything as a mistake. Learn from it, evolve and adapt. If time gets tough, use that to be tougher. That's the secret of life and to living the way you want.

You enjoy what you do, and you get rewarded for it, and using that reward gives you the flexibility to make more and better art. This also creates the situation where you progress your skill. This creates momentum; instead of pushing yourself to do something, you are pulled towards it.

### The ultimate reward

The reward is proximity to the problems that you want to solve. So know this if you play, you will have the chance to level up the play, and that is the biggest reward in craft - to be able to do a better craft. Now in any craft, you will connect with the individuals who are better than you in some aspects and therefore, you will grow holistically. You want to surround yourself with leaders that will lead you to win the battles that you have or the ones that will come. Make sure you exchange the same by being the leader and develop yourself.

Proximity is power, some say. Proximity is power over problem, is what I believe! I say if you are with people who have the same problems as you, and who seek to solve them then you obviously will more likely solve them. With proximity, you might find people who have access to the resources that you don't have, or knowledge or skill that you don't possess. Some say you get a higher economical reward if you are with people who can influence more and in control of more resources. While that is true, it still comes down to why you are doing what you are doing and what drives you.

Surround yourself with the best people. You will become who you hang out with.

### Play for hunting

We have gotten so serious with life matters that we have forgotten to play. Wolves play in order to become better hunters. When we become older, we stop playing, and we take things way too seriously. Of course, taking things seriously puts systems in place, but it also makes things very numbing and purposeless. Playing makes things fun, and when they are fun, you live more. Philosophical idea of freedom of thoughts and information is what I believe that everyone must have to be an expert to express his or herself without constraints.

### Control your state all day

Affirmations and emotional Neuro-Linguistic Programming anchors help with making you stronger and changes your state of mind when you want to. Building one is super important, as it changes the state of mind instantly, and it's great to be able to control your state whenever you want to. To make one, you can do this: clench your fist and imagine something that gives you emotions. It can be a house that you want, a partner, etc., and think and multiply that emotion over and over many times; then you can associate that with the word and say it out loud or inside your mind and, here you go, you've made an anchor.

To make an affirmation, you can make it with this first phrase: "I am who I am," and that essentially bypasses the sub-consciousness critique; when you say you are who you are, it's not a question, it's not a statement, and it’s a fact. The hormones changes based on your anchors, so make sure you are in control of your anchors.

The quick shortcut for calming yourself in a stressful situation: whenever a stressful situation arises, stop and focus on the lobe. Studies on EEG showed that this creates the slow-down of the waves, which in fact leads to calming the brain. You can do that with closed eyes, so no one is looking. That way, you slow down the brainwaves and therefore take control of yourself. Mainly, stress is caused by the brain going too fast, beta waves, and that will create the confusion and no solutions as it can overwork the brain.

When you are overworked, ask yourself why. Ask why you are doing this or that? Create the mental image to get your back into the state that you want to be.

### Bonus tricks

#### The uniform

Wear a uniform. Having a uniform is like wearing an identity, and having an identity makes life simple. Many successful people wear it as it frees the thinking power because you don't have to think of what to wear when you wake up. Sometimes, that decision lasts until lunchtime, which is sad. Imagine what you could do with that time!!!!Just make sure you change wash them so buy in bulk.

#### Switch off the phone when with someone

We are so hardwired to our devices that it became an addiction to many people. Our happiness levels increase or decrease based on the number of followers we have. We get happy when we get a text. When we are sad, we send a bunch of text messages and wait for a reply. We are getting hardwired and disengaged with the people around us, and we need to take that aspect away. The phones made us lonely and divided. If you have power over someone to make their phone off when you are with them, then do that. Your conversation will be much better, and you will connect on a deeper level. I think people should use the technology to their advantage and not fill themselves with useless information that will not produce any results.

#### Measure impact.

There is an exercise that I call Measure time. Measure, which essentially is once a week where you estimate the results and achievements of what you do. This way, you can make sure that you do what you need to do. It is also a reflective thing. There are some parts that might not be so easily measurable, for example, if you are an artist, then you don't really want to measure the number of paintings done, as you are missing on the quality. So, you can apply this exercise once a week, monthly, quarterly or yearly. It all depends on you.

#### Ikigai

What is ikigia? It is a way of living a constant search for the purpose and balance of what you want and what you do. Ask yourself these questions: Who am I? Am I a lover? Am I a model? Am I a person that inspire growth in other people?  Statistically, if you live with the purpose, you are 3 times more likely to live to a 100 years.  I want to ask you; what is your purpose? Having the right answer to this will make you live longer.

#### How to find your ikigai!

Well, technically, you will seek that until you die. But having said that, you can always refine it and make sure you are closer to the level that you want. How to discover your ikigai? Make a rating of 1-10 of what you are good at, what you love, what the world needs, and the skills that can fetch you money. Check where you have the highest rating. Ensure that you do not get below 3-4 for the other ones so you can easily make a decision.

#### Play in the sandbox

Taking life seriously is the first mistake. You can be in control of life but know some stuff are not worth controlling. Play in the sandbox and never let success get to your head and failure into your heart. Control your ego. My recommendation is to do what you love, and then you will create something so beautiful and be proud of, and after achieving small successes, your confidence will boost so you will fly high…

Have the work environment and eliminate all the distractions. Listen to music. If you have to do something that you don’t like, break them down into chunks - 30 minutes active and 5-10 minutes rest and repeat, rather than jump into it with anger. When you do something you truly find joy in, time will be infinite and energy will come to you without thinking.

#### While traveling

You can set the audiobook that will play, imagine how much information you will get from doing that. If you are a passenger in a vehicle and the journey is an hour of daily commute, read a book.

#### Judging people

Don't judge and you will not be judged, people react differently to a different environment, have different endocrine condition at different times based on foods that they ate, time they woke up and the situations that happened to them. When you are working with people, and it's not really working out, don't judge them. Instead, think outside the box and find the way you can work together.

#### Lunch with someone

Having lunch with someone that you really want to know is a great way to connect, and you need to have it; we are social creatures and eating together helps us develop.

#### Location, legislation and location

Know the legislation that you are working with, different societies have less trust built as people are surviving and therefore the brain that is responsible for that is dominating and so they will think more short term.

#### Walking meetings.

Walking meetings are great, just try it. I need not talk more on some stuffs because they are self-explanatory already. You will understand the benefits better when you try it.

#### Evening meet ups.

Those meet-ups are like closers and sorters of people who are coming to solve the same problem and are interested in the same topic. Those meet-ups are very useful if you want to develop your mindset.

#### Your circle changes who you are…

Being romantic about your network is great, but understanding who you are around with is very important… Spend your time with people that you grow, and give back to people who you can help grow, as it is give and take, and believe me, I’ve learned so much by sharing the information and so much by receiving.

We mix and match with people! We are a creation of decision that we take on daily basis. We are the products of our decisions.

#### The group mentality

Joining the club and having the instinct of connecting with a group without a hired Leader is normal. Create one or join the one that you think you can add more value to, or obtain some from. Monkeys will outshout other groups to show the size of their group, and they will feel confident especially if they are a larger group. The group shouts of humans will instinctively outshout the other group to make the other group scared subconsciously. It's not information exchange; it's about power.


#### Regarding lying

There is something you should know about lying. When you lie, you have to remember the lie. The lies grow to the point that it becomes obvious when you are trying to cover it up. So it then ruins your reputation and that will create a set of problems for you and for other people.

#### Live on less than you make

Learn to live on less than you make; that is the basics of making money. Living on less of what you make will give you the idea, skill set and thinking that there is always an abundance and that will create the forward moving motion.

#### Empathic listening

Empathic listening is super important. Tell me, how can you help someone without understanding them first, without feeling their value system and without feeling their emotions? To help someone, you need to listen and give them your full attention. In order to feel, you have to be less distracted, you have to be with the person fully present otherwise, you will not grasp the information that will help you build that connection and build a true win-win relationship. It's the information you get from the person that will help you determine the way forward.

You will know what the other person wants and need more accurately, and that will help propel the movement towards the direction where both sides will reach a compromise.

Whenever I call someone on the phone, I close my eyes and I try to imagine myself seated with the person. I try to send love to the person even before I call him or her.  It’s a meditation but also filters my emotions.

If you find the conversation boring, then you are not listening. Why not you go for a deeper conversation? You need to get information as much as possible. Enough information will help you make a more rational and more informed decisions so you can live a better life.

Personal trust Connect > Like > Trust > Professional trust

Credibility > respect > trust Knowledge skill and capability.

Trust is a connection, and connections create everything.

#### Theurapeutic relationship.

Therapeutic relationship is the form of relationship where both sides talk and go deep into each others psyches to make sure that they live the life that makes them better. Now if your relationship is not therapeutic then what is it ? Is it a monkey hierarchy where you go and attack each other ? Maybe it's a form of relationship where one partner is a tyrant and the other is a slave to emotion.

#### Being present

Be present. The problem I see with many people and myself is that being present is getting hard with all distraction. Our attention span is getting smaller and smaller with apps that give you instant gratification, and that makes our lifestyle to be faster (which isn’t bad) but it is bad when you require to give your self for long term and building a family, business, career and long term gratification requires that.


#### The environment In Play for play

The environment is super important, which makes it a key for the world. The idea behind this is that we changed our environment in last thousand years and till now our genetics hasn't caught up, and this poses a large problem. We are over stressing ourselves as we are not living the way we were designed by our ancestors. As a matter of fact, our epigenetic markers get the signal that we should change and that the environment requires us to change. But saying that, if we want to live a very productive life while not focusing on purely commercial aspects of life and being a balanced individual, we have to identify the environment that we live in and what we can do to make it better.

#### Training soft skills

To train your soft skill, I recommend doing this: First be aware, what are the most crucial factors of soft skills? Soft skills are first about connecting with other people. If your phone vibrates in your pocket every few minutes, I don't think your attention will be towards the person that is in front of you, so empathy is not just about feeling the other person, it is also about being clear, so when you are with them, you are truly with them. The second factor that is super important is cultural competency and being flexible.  Having the observation and knowledge of how to bring yourself into a different environment allows you to be flexible, and it's not about impressing other persons, it is about making sure that the other side can empathize with you. Thirdly and in my belief is the most important, is the cultural curiosity.

Live and learn the freedom of thought and defeating the fear of not being liked. Do the random approach situation as this is unprepared and gets you going on your feet as you have to think quickly on what to say. If you want go to the conferences, meet ups and make a quota that you have to meet at least 10 people and exchange conversation with, you can have a prepared agenda. But you should know that a free dialog coming from a mind that is unprepared is the way to go and the on that really build trust

#### Regarding speaking to the mass audience

There are no such things as public speaking. Talking to a mass audience is more like connecting to a set of group of people linked together.  Building eye contact is very important, so if you want to develop the speaking abilities next to the set of people, try to exercise first by looking at someone in the eye for a long period of time and then you will develop that aspect. Before starting the speech, say things like: "I am glad that I am here, I am glad that you are here, and I care about you. Connect with your audience emotionally.

#### Building the reputation

Learn to be difficult when it counts. You will build to be assertive and you will have a reputation that you get what you want without fighting for it every time.

#### Awareness

One of the first things that schools should teach is awareness. We live in an awareness-seeking world, where we need to grab the awareness of others to survive. This isn't good because there is a limit to the information that our brain can process at a specific time. As such, we need to let go of unnecessary things that grab our awareness.

Like a car, in order to drive faster, it needs more horsepower, but it also needs to be lighter and have less drag. If you are aware of too many things, it will burn your brain and lead you to analysis paralysis, and if you are aware of too little, then you are ignorant. You have to be selective with information that you gather and with people that you interact. Before improving the world, we have to improve ourselves, and in order to do so, we have to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses that we have so we find what can complement us.

#### The brain break

When tired, do a few pushups and take a cold shower. Recall that I have talked about the importance of a cold shower. While cold shower helps to raise your beta endorphins, pushups ensures that blood moves freely in your body. Standing blood is the worst thing that can happen to you.

#### Do good to other people

When you do good to others, you'll observe that something good happens to you instantly. And if not instantly, the universe has a way of paying you back. Take for example: You are inside a plane and you discover that the person next to you is disabled and he doesn't feel comfortable at the seat he was given. You go ahead to switch seats with him and instantly the flight attendant gives you a better seat. It's hard to explain but the universe is governed by laws of exchange and when you do good to people, the world gives you good situations, connections and reputation.

#### Spread the love

It's super important to spread the knowledge and increase the understanding of different fields and life as it will pass to you and make your life more interesting.

Knowledge > experience > emotions > understanding > wisdom > evolution

Our journey is about being less attached to things while being deeper than ever

Life is Harmonious chaos - chaos where we are balanced in a way.
