## MAP 1: Focus Meditation

Focus meditation is the most important activity or ritual. The idea here is to condition your body to run fast and be super productive by doing the right thing. Focus meditation is important as it gives you direction and charges you to ask questions and eliminate the stuff that are slowing you down. Suffice it to say that making focus meditation a habit will push you forward and keep your eyes on your goals even in tough times. Remember I mentioned earlier that the first twenty minutes after you wake up is important? The moment you wake up, ask yourself, what are the things I'm concentrating on and what do I hope to achieve from them? Asking yourself these questions basically pushes your brain, helps you to focus, reflect and create. When we wake up, our brains are clear and devoid of emotions. So at that time, you are bit reacting but naturally observing. That is the best time to reflect on the things you are doing and visualize positive results. It's at that time of waking up that the brain separates the unimportant from important, and give you clarity so you can make important decisions quickly without hesitation.

Focus is a critical part of meditation. The human brain has two default modes; the reactive mode and the focused alpha mode. The reactive mode is the one that reacts to nature, and the focused alpha mode is the one that is forward-looking people work with. Now, our body requires both modes to be at the top of their game.

The number one ritual you need to do at the beginning of the day is taking charge of your brain's reactive behavior. The aim of the focus ritual is for you to develop the neural network responsible for abstract thinking and focus. Now, this activity isn't as difficult as it sounds. The simplest version of focus meditation is to ask yourself a question: "What am I focusing on? “ When you answer the question, proceed to ask yourself why. Repeat these questions and provide answers until you are sure that your answers match with your value system. Note that the more you this reactively, the faster the balance will shift towards proactive thinking. You'd agree with me that having the idea of what you want out of life the minute you wake up boosts your confidence and drives you to pursue your goals. The idea here is to hack your focus and make your brain seek the things you want. Yes, you want to achieve some goals in life, but the reality is some goals take many years to achieve. But by adding or eliminating, you will know the exact goals you want for yourself. Your goals will become clearer and you will be more excited about life as with every step to towards will give you most of happy neurotransmitters.

Focus meditation helps your brain to work more effectively. There are many ways to meditate; snoozing is a notable mention. When your alarm sounds, snoozing will help you focus meditate. While some people manage to stay in bed and meditate for twenty minutes after the alarm goes off, others fall asleep immediately. To avoid going back to sleep, when I wake up, the first thing I do is state my value and reflect on the things that are important to me. To make this easy for you, all you need to do is to set different alarms. When the first one goes off, remind yourself not to get out of bed because you are waiting for the second alarm that will go off in 20 minutes. Use the 20 minutes to focus meditate, state your values and reflect on the things that are important to you.

Also, this time can be used to reflect on your dreams. Yes, your dreams! Our dreams are the medium by which the subconscious speaks to us. What you see in your dreams is what your subconscious focuses on. That is, you subconscious reveals to you in your dreams what it’s focuses on. Our dreams is also the medium by which our brain communicate with us. Breaking down your dreams into small parts will help you understand them, and when you have nightmares, you will not be frightened because you know it's a picture of what you have on your subconscious. To fully understand your dreams, you need to figure out and understand how your brain works. Simply write your dreams down in a journal to analyze their meanings. Often, our subconscious send us answers in our dreams. I have had many answers that came in my dreams. Also, I won't fail to mention that your subconscious feeds on your emotions, so you want to focus your emotions on positive things before sleeping.

### The pool

The idea of meditation is making sure that you use your pool of energy wisely. Meditation entails calming the pool of energy and ensuring that you are conscious of how to use it and having it ready at your disposal. You are the director of your health and happiness, so you want to make sure that you focus on the right things. Do not stress yourself by focusing on things that doesn't matter to you. Preserve your energy, focus on the important things and you will find that stress is far away from you. You should also know that chronic stress speeds up the aging process through oxidation. Stress does nothing good than create an acidic environment that makes you more acidic and feast on your living cells and energy.

Furthermore, focus meditation helps you to hack dopamine. If you can hack your dopamine, then you can turn anyone into an addict. How can you hack your dopamine? You can hack your dopamine by simply discovering what you want. The best time to hack your dopamine is when you wake up and when you go to bed. Hacking your dopamine demands you having a big tough goal and then ensuring that your activities in a day are done in an orderly fashion which draws you near to the realization of the goal.

Not to worry, at the end of this book, you will be familiar with your brain and how it works as well as the many processes in your body and what triggers you.

Some nuggets for focus meditation

### Trick to wake up faster

Often times, we find it difficult to get out of bed. You have an important meeting to get to, you know you need to get out of bed at a particular time but your body refuses. I have a trick for you - the adrenal jump start. How do you do the adrenal jump start? While in bed, take about 20 to 30 deep breaths breathing in and out. Make sure to hold the breath as deeply and longer as you can and when you can’t hold no more take a one really deep breath and hold that for 15-20 seconds and let go. When you do this, you will feel your heart pumping and your body will have no choice than to get out of bed. And when you are out of bed, you should do a set of push-ups to utilize the adrenaline you spiked. Now, there is a story behind this trick. Do you care to know?

There is an inventor who made more patents than anyone on the planet. This inventor dives underwater and do not come out until he has a new invention. Note that the inventor carried this out in a controlled environment, so don't risk your life by going under water. Instead, do few sets of adrenal jumps while increasing the speed of breathing. The inventor uses biology to his advantage. When you lower oxygen and increase carbon dioxide, the brain receives a signal that it's in danger and when the brain senses this, it raises creativity by firing more neurons just so it can survive. It's safer to do the adrenal jump start as it releases the hormone adrenaline that is responsible for the rapid beating of the heart. Do not overdo the adrenal jump start, there is a possibility to pass out should you overdo it.

Looking at it from a neurological point of view, adrenal jump start also helps you to reassess your priorities. When your brain senses danger, it rewires itself and that helps you set aside things that aren't important. Also, you can use the adrenal jump start as a form of meditation.

### Bonus trick: Internal Vacuum

The adrenal jump start exercise also helps to train your internal core muscles. Simply hold your stomach in when you do an adrenal jump start. This action helps to build strength in your internal core thereby preventing your gut from sticking out as you age. Your organs are carefully placed in their position to function properly but when the gut sticks out, it repositions your organs and cause them to function less efficiently.

### Diversified vs centered focus

Likewise the focused focus and diversified focus meditation is very important. If you think specific focus or focused focus helps you to develop attentive learning and keep your brain focused, the diversified focus does much more. The diversified focus is very investigative as it helps you to see the whole world as it is and the way people live. The notion that most people are searching for their career path stems from both diversified focus and focused focus.


### When to wake up

I argue that waking up early keeps your spirit up and helps you to achieve whatever you set to do in a day. I'm sure many will agree with this. The ideal time to wake up is 4am. Your bedtime routine should be from 10pm - 4am. You may find it difficult to adjust to this routine at the beginning, but not to worry, your body will get adjusted to it in no time. You can always catch up on sleep at weekends. Remember that we are not wired the same way, while some people can handle this routine, others cannot. So don't force yourself!


### Bonus trick. Vision board

You need to do this! Design a vision board on your phone or anything you watch frequently. It will be safe to design your vision board on your laptop phone wallpaper, so you see it continuously. I recommend that you create a password for your laptop and phone. A password that reminds you of your goal and drive you to think more. Also, use a background picture that shows the things you want out of life. This will help you live the life you intend for yourself as your brain sees what you want in the background picture and hunts for it.

You will be amazed at how much your body is capable of doing the impossible. You have to break your vision down into steps and take each step a day at a time, and after some time, when you look back, you'll be glad you took those steps. Decide on what you really want and make your vision board.  You are responsible for your life, your ideas and goals. Only you can decide on the ideas and the interest of life. We are the creators of life and we are creators of what we want.

### Focus on the focus

You need to figure out why you are focusing on something. Doing this will help you figure out what interests you and what ticks you. The idea here is that the body will create the rhythm that will push you further ahead and that will help you with the development of life.

### Bonus trick: laugh like crazy

Laugh more! Laugh like crazy! Do not allow bad situations get to you, instead laugh it off. If something is bothering you, laugh for a few minutes. I assure you that after you laugh, you won't see the problem as a problem anymore. Just laugh, and you will observe your thoughts change from impossible to possible, from this is messed up to it can be handled.
