## MAP 3: COLD ENVIRONMENT


Most people find cold water to be great and refreshing which is true. But what they fail to tell you is why cold water is good for you. I will tell you why. Whenever you drink or bathe with cold water, blood rushes from your skin to your organs which is an evolutionary protecting response that ensures that you are warm and protected. When your body comes in contact with cold water, your body strives to protect your internal organs, after all losing a finger is better than losing a liver. While taking a cold shower, you will find that you automatically start breathing rapidly. This is because your body requires you to charge it with enough energy to move blood around to your internal organs. Also, there are some tiny muscles very close to the skin which the body needs to push blood to the internal organs. So, your body charges you with energy that immediately triggers the tiny muscles to begin their work. So when you breathe rapidly, you alkalize your blood to get it charged to move towards the internal organs. People who are familiar with alkaline water should know that alkaline water is ionized, that is, it is charged with electricity.  The process of alkalizing blood can be achieved using different methods with one of them as breathing. Other methods will be discussed further in the maps.

The human blood contains iron; an element on the periodic table which is a great conductor of electricity. So, when you breathe rapidly, your blood grab the toxins in your body with higher efficiency and transport them away from your organs. Thereby, ridding your body of toxins and heavy metals.

Another benefit of cold water is that it makes your blood grab nutrients effectively and deliver them to the appropriate destination. This way, your organs have less toxins to accumulate, therefore, your organs have less problem, better overall performance, fewer mutations and higher efficiency.

 One of the key things to note is that conductivity heightens in a cold environment with less friction. That is, we feel the electricity quicker in a cold environment than just breathing rapidly. Going further, when you breathe rapidly, your blood also send electric signals to your brain to focus because the brain thrives on electricity and by the time you step out of the shower, you will find that you are happier. Basically, cold shower helps to increase neuro-plasticity, as electricity helps the brain to rewire its connections.

Cold water helps to boost your willpower while ridding your organs of toxins, that sends positive signals to your brain that your organs and cells are in great condition. After your cold water experience, you will feel so good because your internal processes was cleaned and your body also burned a few calories to warm you up and bring you to a relaxed state of mind. Because of the delightful feeling that accompanies cold shower, you'll desire to go back again and again.

### Progression

We will take a look at the first progression where you can control the cold environment in cold plunges, and in the shower. The progression allows you to sit in the cold at will and whenever you want.

Here is an example of the progression you can do. Make sure to do it daily so you will get accustomed to it faster.

### 1st Week

Start by taking a warm shower for as long as you want, then switch to a cold shower for 30 seconds. When the 30 seconds of cold shower is up, your body begins to heat up, and this essentially helps with the production of mitochondria especially when your body shivers.

### 2nd week

Take a cold shower for 30 seconds, then a warm shower for 30 seconds and finally a cold shower for 30 seconds.

Here, you are training your body pores to close up and open up again. Also, you are training your cardiovascular system to close up and transport the blood to your internal organs to keep them warm and open up to lose the heat, close up again and open up. The closing and opening up mechanism help to train all the muscles of the cardiovascular system. That is, the opening and closing up mechanism helps to train all the muscles responsible for transporting the blood.

### 3rd week

Take a cold shower for 30 seconds, then a warm shower for 30 seconds, a cold shower for 30 seconds, a warm shower for 30 seconds and finally a cold shower for 30 seconds.

Here, you are giving your cardiovascular system and pores a workout. I trust that you feel great after taking the cold shower?

### 4th week

Take a cold shower for 10 minutes.

Here, you are training your body to handle cold for a specific period and to keep itself warm for a specific period.

### 5th week from here you can do two to three times a week

Sit in the cold bath for 10 minutes

Here, the body faces a greater challenge as you essentially have more surface area with cold environment over it.

### 6th week

Sit in the bath filled with ice for 10 minutes.

Now you have increased the surface area, and the water is much colder. Here, you are training your body to keep itself warm. Blood moves around the body more quickly in this state.

### 7th week

Sit in the bath filled with ice for 10 minutes and mediate.

Here, you are training yourself to get hotter when you want to. The act of meditation works here as you shift your focus on the pituitary gland that is responsible for the production of neurotransmitters and charge you will electricity so you body is capable of sending enough communication around the body to deal with the environmental issues,.

### 8th week

Sit in the cold bath for half an hour and meditate.

Here, your body will get used to the cold. You will be very comfortable in the cold so much that you will read a book and you will not shake. This is really cool, and for people who wants to shed some pounds, this is one of the ways to go.

I understand that engaging in weekly meditation in the cold for half an hour can be burdensome, but not to worry, you will see the results after some time and you will be glad you did it. By the time you get used to the progression of the cold bath, you'll be amazed at how much cold your body can take. You will even find yourself placing iced plastic bottles in the bath to make the water colder. This not for all some bodies do like hotter climates but even still I will recommend you to train your self to get into that state where you can control your state.

Some nuggets for cold environment

### Bonus tip - shower temperature.

Take a cold shower before working out as it helps to increase testosterone and release lactic acid from the muscles. If the goal of your workout is to build muscles, you want to take a cold shower before the workout and a warm shower after the workout. Lactic acid is important for muscle growth and warm shower do not reduce the amount of lactic acid in the body. More importantly, taking a cold shower before working out makes you tougher and puts you in control of your body. Also, taking a cold shower gives you a huge rush of energy.

On the flip side, a warm shower helps to speed up the production of the growth hormone that is responsible for preserving the cells in the body and keeping you younger.

### Meditation in the cold environment

I recommend a bit of Tai Chi dance after deep breathing to allow the body flow itâ€™s energy naturally.

Taking a cold shower in the morning is like preparing yourself for the day and the future decisions you will make to achieve your results.

Focus on lobe - get to homeostasis.

When taking a cold shower, focus on your third eye to regulate your internal environment. It's natural for you to shiver when you enter a cold bath. While in the cold environment, the body pass through different stages where it receives information from outside that some activity is taking place inside. Focusing on your third eye helps to bring you into homeostasis where the shaking stops and you are calmer. At this point, you are the one in control.

On a daily basis, train yourself to get into a peak state, and before you know what's happening, you will become an expert at it. One of the ways to achieve this is focusing in the cold environment. While in the cold environment, focus on the top of your head to move energy to your head and gain control over your body.

I have experimented with cold a lot. The idea is telling the brain to get into homeostasis and have control over nature. And the more you do it, the easier it will become. It'll even get to the point where you can control your body to get to homeostasis without much efforts. Instead of stressing out and shaking in the cold, you train your body to be comfortable outside your comfort zone.

### Bonus trick

Place an ice pack behind your neck in the evening time. This incites the production of brown fat, the fat responsible for generating heat which has more mitochondria.

### Bonus tip - Breathe through the stomach.

Train yourself to breathe through your stomach, and not the chest. Breathing through the stomach is natural, and it helps you to inhale enough oxygen into your system. Also, breathing through the stomach helps to switch on the part of the parasympathetic nervous system that is responsible for relaxing the body.

### Idea factory

You will be amazed at how many ideas you come up with when you are sitting in the cold bath. In the cold bath, the body is in a state of relaxation and we tend to lower our guard. In our relaxed state, our brain waves slow down and we come up with different and creative ideas.

Brush your teeth with an opposite hand to create a greater communication between hemispheres.

 Get out of the cold when feel the burn or feel fear.

I jump out of the cold the moment I sense fear. Fear is natural and it is present in everyone. So whenever you sense fear or you feel the skin is burning while in the cold, jump out immediately.

### Super important!!!!

Refrain from doing adrenal jump in the shower. You can pass out and die when you block your breathing for a long time. You have been warned! Likewise, don't breathe too much in cryogenics; inhaling too much nitrogen can kill you.
