## ABOUT THE AUTHOR

First, I am a writer. I believe you know that already. I am an entrepreneur, a musician and I love to carry out experiments. I recently undertook new projects at wavesglasses.com which progressed into oxvy.com and I am also involved in grid.systems .I believe that focus makes things happen and this is why @focusmake or focusmake.com focuses on media platforms. This book is written by someone who lives in a different part of a separate world trying to understand himself to have better understanding of who he is and how he reacts to events. This person is determined to master himself, understand his map and ensure that traveling as a traveler is an easy task anytime, anywhere.
