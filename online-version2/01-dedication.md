## DEDICATION
To my cherished father, a great mentor, who taught me about life and has always been there for me. To my mother, who loves me unconditionally and always supported my dream and to my friends and family who supported me. I'm exceedingly thankful to my mentors who has always been my guide and helped me not to shatter my dreams against the wall. I'm also thankful to all the people who provided me with the resources I needed to carry out researches and experiments. Also, I won't fail to mention those people who presented themselves as experiments.

More importantly, I dedicate this book to those who made me an important version of myself by challenging me. These people challenged me physically and mentally, they went as far as fighting me and abusing my trust. I wouldn't have been here if not for these challenges. I'm thankful for the challenges and how you have made me a stronger person today. I'm thankful for their negative and positive criticism. Thank you all!!!
