## MAP 6: CREATIVE CRITIQUE & ARTIST WITHIN

The former steps have gone the extra mile to charge the brain with the help of either a lemon drink or tea, conventionally referred to as alkaline. The alkalinity is a charge and therefore helps with neuroplasticity and neurogenesis with the assurance of one performing faster and more efficiently. Very well, the cold shower not only woke you up, but also increased the alkalinity in your blood, which again increases the charge. For instance, the adrenal does the same, the adrenal jump also increases alkalinity.

### Regarding hunger

Do you know that a hungry artist is regarded as a great artist; skipping breakfast is an accomplice to this or creating something fasted when you are hungry for the art. I do focus on artistic expression earlier between 3, and 6 am, due to the fact that no one distracts me. If you want to stay more focused for a much-extended period, you’ll definitely need to isolate yourself. Also, you can set a measure with a fixed amount of minutes/hours, thereby building a habit which will help design a masterpiece over time, depending on your standards. Also, being isolated gives you the chance to consider tradeoffs without being distracted.

What exactly is about hunger? We have grown to hunt, and it can be deduced that when we are hungry, we are much more focused as our brain instructs us to pursue. When we eventually get food, we get relaxed, which is also suitable for observation and recovery, but it’s a different case when it comes to crafting.

One thing which always proves me right about art is that, no matter what you do, it’s is pretty much advisable to explore ceaselessly, because you never know which will work better for the ideas. Examine different areas and fields, and not except learning over and over again until you can create useful art.

Once you stop creating, that implies that you’ve traded the emotions which you have towards the life you live, and you’ve accepted the mediocrity of what is out there and stopped improving yourself or the world around you.

### Being human

It has been the basis of debates over time that computers will substitute human beings in diverse aspects of life. Presently, what's important is to focus on how to develop the techniques which are most likely to be replaced at the end of this lifecycle to bring about our resourcefulness or usefulness to the society. Human beings who have evolved empathy, i.e., those who can (feel other people’s emotions) will understand what is essential and what isn't. Those that have gotten a grasp of what is essential will be the last being left on this planet as useful individuals. The idea of evolution is also crucial in developing the creative minds which will help many people to live longer because computers cannot take the broad spectrum of information types such as: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, smell and taste and also begin to combine them as we have grown out of it through millions of years or so. So, learn a lot of context have something that keeps your heart beating and learn to be creative.

Love life and it will reciprocate it. Create a world that will grow to make the world a better place.


### Ideas

An artist who has a lot of ideas that he/she works with is susceptible to issuing greater benefits to the society. If you have lots of ideas, then you can filter and keep the good ones. Ensure that you have an idea file you fill; this can be actualized in the morning because the brain is fresh at that time, and so it’ll be very much efficient on bringing ideas with fewer emotions swimming inside. Ideas, either good or bad all depends on how you define them. Just come up with a lot of it then you realize you will have a library to choose from with time.

As regards what we do in art; we rearrange, contribute and subtract when dealing with art. In that case, don't be overwhelmed with the idea that craft is superb. Instead, cycle it through the market and then proceed to craft and to inspire people. As regards with the AI overtaking your life, ensure that you carry out a craft that AI cannot work with, as trade-offs are super hard to undertake, and if tradeoffs are repetitive, then AI will be more likely take the spot.

“Examples of how ideas are to be written. Topic- Romance: Make sure that I am kind to people. Topic - Phone - Add Camera to the phone that can see X-ray. Topic - Chorus hook. I love roses, and roses love me, what can I say, give them to me”!

Now, it's left for our heart to set us in motion and for our brain to pull the breaks. The simple hack is, do what you love and kill the breaks, and also be rest assured that you will never die like Mozart, Chopin, and Beethoven who just became music; like Picasso, Dali and Rothko who became the paint.


### The brain vomit

Give the idea of brain vomit a try on the creative side or part when you create tons of ideas which can be useful for you in making your craft. Everything is a craft and  the simple hack that’ll suffice is to express as much as you can without judgement. A simple idea states that ‘both the mind and brain uses the body to do what is needed to be done in its superb way’. Your mind gets hold of pieces of information which can be useful for you in creating the content and that will help you with the development of knowledge and the lifestyle you desire.

This simple idea here states that the brain helps in creating things that is neither useful nor helpful, you are not judging the creativity, you are just allowing the brain to release and let go of all the aspects of creativity.

Try this as an exercise draw a hood of the car two wheels and a trunk. Pass it to your friend and ask him what does he sees. If he said car than he thought about it if he said a monkey with big eyes he thought of something else. The idea here is that a person comes up with solutions based on a previous experience and a creative genius is someone who was exposed to many ideas, systems and solutions which made him or her aware of potential similar solution in a different environment.

### The idea of when and not why


Engage in deep reading well if you want to widen the field of knowledge as doing reading and research on the topics are super helpful.

Fiction books hold so importance as it will help calm yourself, think of the future and stimulate further ideas of creation and the development of new ideas so much that your body and mind can create more connections and interpretations.

Unity eradicates or removes negativity just as sunlight removes darkness. If we are without an idea, we are good as nothing. We are like a bowl of consciousness that seeks to solve something to make the life better for our self or others.

### Community of artist

There is a community or gathering of people who are called creators. A community where discipline and persistence is very important in developing one's expression, the way we work, and the knowledge of life. I believe that as humans, we create a constant hybrid of everything, even ourselves. Making researches of the best in the field will help you understand who you are.

The only thing that can be noted most, in my opinion, is for us to evolve faster than possible and also help the world to evolve as fast as possible, for the benefit of all!!

Have you ever taken your time to think about why some people work all the time, and some do not? It is well said that the energy is fueled or boosted by emotion. Once you have a great reason, you definitely will do more of what is needed to be done quicker. So, first of all, get to know the reason why something must be done, not everything is enjoyable, even in the actions you don’t like, you can derive joy. We should have a minimum environment which will not bring about distractions in the art that we are doing. Ensure that phones are switched off and should be hard to reach, as it takes some time to switch focus as your internal neurological processes needs time to change the course.

Ultimately, find one infinite loop where you learn more about the world and get ideas and inspire yourself to do more and create more in life. Make proper use of your strength and develop them to make sure that you push forward! Find people who can complement you on your weaknesses!

### Mentors

It is imperative to have a mentor or someone in your relative industry that you are looking up to and makes you build models of how to create your identity. Of course, it is possible to have many mentors to a person; nevertheless, not all of them have to be one to one. There can also be mentorship from the videos, books, and seminars as those things explain the ideas of life. Every individual has different ideas based on the models that he or she constructed, and those ideas will be added or subtracted based on the visions that the person has. Someone can also help along the way and shape you to be a better individual thereby promising a better life. We pick up the emotions of people who are around us. Just being around your great mentors will help you produce great results.

Surround yourself with strong people! Who will not allow you to rest or get complacent!

### Focus-make method

The focus-make method is the idea of convergence and divergence thinking with adding different ideas on top. When we develop something, we are considering tradeoffs that are there to make the product or service, or person, a habit or whatever it is converge based on the environmental limitations of available parts and economics. This convergent thinking creates the flow of ideas, so to make a great idea, you have to think of thousands, and you have to cut through and choose the one that you think will create value thats when empathy comes as computers will not be able to sense what’s valuable and what is not until full upload of a human brain. The convergence is the hardest to decide when you are closer to the center, closer to completion as tradeoffs become larger and more significant to consider. The illustration of two triangles will help you with understanding the focus-make method. The tipping point creates the foundation of new ideas to come. Converging helps the brain to realize what is more important and that creates the habits to asses at what time of the lifecycle of the evolution of the world and individual to form a right action.

The Focus-make method essentially is the method of decision-making where you decide on the spot while knowing the past data and the day as you will create the abundance of ideas and you have to keep them usable as possible. I can't say how to record ideas as it's up to you, as different crafts will do it differently at the end of the day, but there are many other factors that need to be considered. There is a tradeoff that converges and diverges. At the start, you have tons of ideas, and then you delete and you keep to shape your vision

The idea of people creating the environment to propel their understanding of life and nature itself while other people question their creations cannot be overemphasized.

### Battling creative block

Creating a creative block comes from an overabundance of information that comes from the outside world, which the brain thinks is important. Usually, creative blocks emerges when the brain is interpreting information as danger and make you feel stressed as a result, and when you are associating that information with the craft that you do. This will slow down your craft development. How to deal with creative block ? First, change the environment. Chill out and take the very simple first step of the crafting art without the attachment to it. In writing, write the first word or sentence; in music, write the first chord and so on in other arts and see where it goes.

Obtain new knowledge and information that will help with the art and de-commit, and by that I mean don't commit to the large task, commit to just writing a simple line. The rest will follow. Now in the brain, it doesn't have more information and art, it's all about adding, subtracting and/or rearranging existing information so when you have the simple line or chord, or paintbrush, the brain will start to do the rest as it will know what to do especially if you set your environment to set you into a flow state. Did you ever wonder why creative people are a bit on the inside? It's because their brain thinks of information they've obtained instead of reacting to news that is out there.

### Traveling artist

When you travel, you come up with stuff, as the brain is in different modes and states, and in a very calm state. Many great ideas were created when traveled, as you are in a very much rested state. I meditate when I travel; it's kind of weird, I must say, but it works for me.

### Art is all about action!

Do less than you think you are capable of doing! Start it and do the easy one first. Take it from the scratch and see how you feel if you want to do more! Have a daily Quota of things to do like two pages! Have incentives to not lose a bet, or get something lost! One big tip is when emotions hit use that energy to create you art don’t waste it.

Develop your taste through experimentation and when you have enough knowledge that it can converge into something different something fundamental than you can create new ideas, new genre, new style and new ways how to live a life with newly improved habits that will make you do more and therefore be more.

### Meditation on art

You can influence your life. The body can be in the state of creation. You create masterpiece over time with habits. Coffees, drugs and meditation and everything influence it. As soon as you are done meditating, your brain falls in a state of peace, in that case, it will enjoy the creative process as it’s the best state to create the content.

When you are in a fear mode, you are not learning those parts of the brain shuts down, and that creates the problem!

Escapism and the idea that people don’t need to produce an illusion of achievement  buttresses the fact that people with weak philosophical minds only live in an illusionary state.

“Stop the fear, and the escape, decide to engage or not”.

Go fast but don't joke with nature! It’s there doing what it's doing because it the way it is!

### Bonus trick: The zone

In the meantime, what I do in most cases is to repeat the same song over and over again to get into the zone. I've created a special song that I call "zone." I've published it out so you can play it on repeat. Those tracks work on me and friends who have heard it.

“You can only learn when your curiosity beats your fears”.

Learn minimalism, it is the genius way of life. They concentrate in the ideas that are somewhat simple, and then fill life with few most important things than many useless ones. This is how they become world class in very few things that has in no doubt helped promote their better self.

Shaman, in ancient Siberia is referred to the person who sees in the dark. In the art of creating comes from seeing the pains of others through you and solving it by understanding it first and finding the weak spots of pain.

“The problem with the world is that people fall in love with things and not with people”.
