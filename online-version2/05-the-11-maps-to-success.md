## THE 11 MAPS TO SUCCESS

Do you know that doing a set of activities that will help add value to people just by engaging in them also changes your life? That is, the set of activities you do to help people also comes back to mold you into the person you want to be. Are you interested in knowing these activities and why you should do them?

I will be sharing the steps in their chronological order, and I will discuss each step extensively so you can develop your master rituals from the steps. Also, we will discuss how to build a progression for the steps to make them more challenging and fun for you. If you ask me, the most awesome and challenging activity I enjoy doing is kettlebell swing. I so much enjoy the activity, little wonder I have progressed to 50kg over a period of two months.

Cold environment involves being in a cold state and staying there for long. With food, it's all about eating the food that are more beneficial to you, and controlling your portion sizes. With sleep, it's about enjoying the comfort of sleep and ultimate rest. You do not need to be in a hurry as we will discuss each activity extensively and how to engage in each successfully. Without holding you any longer from the fun, we will begin to explore the maps.
