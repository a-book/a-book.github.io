## MAP 7 EXERCISE

THE GENETIC EXPRESSION

Overtime, I’ve asked myself times without number how to go about doing a super quick workout, one that is convenient the same way, and doesn't require much of the equipment or no equipment if I am traveling. After digging and experimenting, I've realized that it’s all about genetic expression. There should be an existing series of exercises that stimulate some of the genetics, but it took me a while to figure out all of this.

There are many stereotypes of what is good and what is bad, and they have changed based on the influence of the few powerful voices. I believe as long as you are healthy, it's great. It's a waste of time to follow a stereotype as they change all the time. Nevertheless, the whole essence of this is to make the best version of who you are.

Reasons to do sport! I have come to discover beyond imagination that more attractive people get other people wanting them in different ways, and that triggers the relationships. The abundant use of computers and phones made our back hunch, and that is not in any way great for our posture. We evolved out of nature's way, and we are sure going back into the primate state with a curved back digressed there a little.

I've tried to create the simplest set that is very easy to do at home with the minimum amount of equipment. There are many ways to exercise, and it's much better to understand what's up with it by doing it in front of a professional who can evaluate your movement. So go for a cross fit class or get a coach, it will teach you how to improve on your exercises. A coach will set a program for you as he or she will see your body type and discuss your goals with you. Since everyone is different, then some people will definitely benefit differently from others, so that is also a reason to go for a session with a coach.

As regard the previous activities when you were in fasted state, you will burn calories from your fat storage instead of glycogen from the muscles and liver. In addition, if you are competing with quick-twitch muscles for activities such as cross fit, wrestling or sprints, then of course, you want some glycogen as it is quicker. But in the trade-off, if you train in a fasted state, you will develop the frontal cortex, as your brain thinks that you are in hunting mode. The growth hormone that the body produces will be used to conserve more muscles after the fast, and you can use that to your advantage. After breathing from a cold shower, you have oxygen in your system, and that will push your body to metabolize the fat quicker, so you can get the activity further. The alkalinity will help with neuron-plasticity thereby enhancing your progress in sports of building neural connections in sports.

As for me, I don't train, what I do simply is, elevate my growth hormones, change my epigenetic response and create a new genetic structure that dominates the other ones.

### Why train at home?

This has been a question a whole lot of people raise in debate. Whichever way, your home or not. If it is your comfort zone and you are at liberty to put anything up when and how you want it so you can do a session without distraction

You save so much time when you train at home especially when it is set as a morning routine. The idea of going to the gym and changing up takes so much time than when you are just at home.


### My foundation of all - the kettlebell swing

Pushing the limit on the kettlebell swing! So I go nuts if I do the exercises by pushing myself to the limits in a messed manner! I go all in for a short period. So I had to stop as I was getting super tired of it! While I was looking for a solution that could fix that case as I was in the gym for way too long, scaring people. I go to find out that one of the solutions was to find a full body exercise that will do cardio and strength at the same time and will develop the posterior chain and essentially a chain of muscles that is responsible for posture. All the muscles and joints that are responsible for mobility are being exercised to build myself and make sure that with age, I am more mobile and able to do more without my aging my body causing a setback. With that, I developed rituals and have set in stone that will help the body to do what it needs to do no matter how old I am as I keep my mobile capacity elevated.

When you look at the tree, what do you see? The branches, the leaves and main foundation that carries all the weight and makes sure that the rest of the plant does what it is supposed to do to survive and thrive. Well, what do you think you should train for the rest of the body to do its functions well? Do you think you should train your biceps or calves or do you think you should train it in one smooth motion that develops the foundation of the body that will train a variety of your systems including nervous, cardiovascular and muscular system all together at high intensity? Do you think you will focus on that exercise and just that exercise alone? If you had a choice to choose that exercise and do that exercise, will you do that and ignore the rest? Do you want to know that exercise?

I’ll tell you, you don't have to do many changes in the movement of it as the progression is straightforward and simple. It's called kettlebell swing. Yep!!! Give a kettlebell swing a try if you are bored of switching the machines.

### Why?

Now, why kettlebell swings?

1. Burns more calories than anything out there.

2. Easy progression, just do more swings in one set or use a heavier kettlebell

3. Whole body movement; trains the whole body.

4. Develops joints, and strengthening your back.

5. Trains variety systems in sync, including nervous and cardio systems.

7. Very convenient to have at home with very little space required

8. You can groom your bum, and you know what that means (for both gender)

9. It is a HIIT exercise

10. It develops core joints for martial arts and powerlifting

11. It makes your booty workout.

Here are the benefits of the kettlebell swings benefits, well, read them again. Ha-ha!!

1. Increased aerobic capacity: If you have challenged yourself to do the sets of the swing

2. Increased anaerobic capacity: This will also create the muscle size, essentially you will create a stronger body.

3. Compound movement of the body:  Due to the fact that it’s a full body compound movement it will make sure that the body

4. Increase overall power: Due to the fact that you are doing a thrust movement from the hip you basically force your body to perform the movement that will develop punches.

5. Increased muscular endurance:  Muscles can contract for a long time and for a short time actually there are two types of muscles that are created in this case. You will create a better endurance and strength.

6. Lymphatic movement: If you look at a cross fit movement, it’s wise to do the lower part of the body and then upper part of the body in one set as you will help the lymphatic fluid to move more rapidly and use your bodies fat storage.

7. Convenience: You basically use a space that is equal of a gaming console that you can set away when you don’t use that will do a great workout that I will say as equipment as having a gym at home without using large space for the equipment.

8. Time efficiency with relation to burning overall calories: I don’t like to count calories and all as I think it takes a mental effort to look out for the calories consumed.

9. Easily scalability: do more reps and or buy a heavier kettlebell - the sky is the limit here. You can be a Good Samaritan and also give one as a present to your friend when you are done

10. Make friends and do it as a competition: Can be done with friends at home. If you have couple of them or one, do it in turns and see who beats who. Of course healthy competition shows how far you have gone but you don’t want to rub your nose to much.

11. Better sex drive: For guys this is crucial as you will be a better performer in bed. Don’t believe me? Try it and you will know what I'm talking about.

12. Increased growth hormone: We will discuss ways by which you can increase growth hormone with eating specific food, having the sleep cycle and going to a hot environment such as saunas or hot shower or bath will produce in the other chapter. The growth hormone is very crucial to keep you looking young and strong

13. Increased testosterone for men: This one is very crucial as when you move with the kettlebell swing or snatch movement, you will essentially produce a pressure around area that will increase testosterone levels. Well, testosterone is very close to the mood regulation and the abilities that will help you think much clearer.

14. Triggering a lot more epigenetic markers than any other workout and that way you make sure that you do a workout that essentially changes your genetics as well as your mental abilities.

15. Leaner body and increased muscle size at the quickest pace; we talked about aerobic and anaerobic capacity but what that leads is the fuel consumption that essentially is fat.

16. Improvement of physical appearance and greater proportions that represent the functional fitness not the cosmetic. I don’t have anything against bodybuilding; I will hold the position that classical bodybuilding from 1970-90s was the peak as there was a real hard consideration in proportion not just mass. Current bodybuilding culture has bloated stomachs that essentially make it very unattractive at least in my eyes, due to the fact that insulin is injected to keep the hunger up and to eat a lot of food to digest. Still I prefer the appearance of a Greek or a Roman mythological sculpture that again is closer than original bodybuilding and cross fit.

17. Sort of meditation itself: People see running works as a meditation for them; it does so as an increase of growth hormone which will make your mind clearer. I believe the reason for that is neurogenesis and as when you have a more neural connection made you will essentially create the abundance of the brain power that you can use to create and do the set of activities.

18. Increased serotonin due to development of posture. The mind body feedback produced through posture and responses of bacteria.

Improved mood;  this applies to every workout really but this one I believe works the best as you can scale it constantly and you can throw in variety such as the rep range, amount of sets, challenges that you set.

Improved looks spill on other aspects of life; this will sound arrogant but when you feel attractive you like what you see in the mirror in the morning and people get your vibe and give you opportunities because of it. It sound strange but it kind of works as snowball effect.


### How?

Did someone just ask me how to go about it? Make sure both legs are parallel, stomach tight, back straight and swing it like you mean it! But to be serious, lifting kettlebell requires practice, so to do it properly. I recommend a professional to take a look at you when you do it once you set your technique right and then you can practice that for a period. I do recommend finding videos how to do it as they will show more than text as this is very visual.


### How to select the starting weight?

How do we select a starting weight with this idea? Selecting the weight of 8kg for females and 16kg for males is not engaging and challenging enough as I've started with 16kg and progressed now to 40kg. The idea is to select a weight that you can do 20-100 swings in one set and do it in 3-5 sets to get a total of 60-500reps in one go. And the larger quantity of reps you do and the more you focus on cardio, the fewer reps you do overall, the more you focus on strength. When you are capable of doing more than 75 swings in one set with a kettlebell, do select a bigger weight in my opinion as it can get a bit boring. I want you to enjoy it with full bum power. I know I sound corny here, but you will get better at it, and you know what I mean! You can do a bit of stretch after like forward bend and backward one to make sure you help loosen up the muscles.

### Tips

Try it barefoot or shoes that have very thin cushion so it’s grounded.

If the kettle bell is about to fall, get out of the way.

Build training load.

When you finish your set do some light activity if your heart rate is elevated.


### Stretch often after or before

Ok, so there was an accidental experiment! I was doing intermittent fasting to the extreme, and I took a kettlebell and started swinging with such ease that was even confusing for me, and the maximum amount of reps went on 20% more than usual! So I was thinking well if you are mainly low on glycogen than what’s going on! Some digging and this comes up! So there were some studies on the time people can spend underwater! When a person in a ketogenic state the time nearly doubled, and with the kettlebell, the situation is that it’s one of the activities that if you do it right, you will have barely any air in you! Now here is the correlation, if you are in the ketogenic state you will produce something which will essentially make you use fat as kind of replacement of and that will use less oxygen in some way.

What to do in a break? The toughest option is pull-ups on rings and dips on rings. Rings do it on! That attaches to pull up bar!  60-80 second between the, and 48 hours recovery! So, doing the 3-6 sets with. You can do alternating as well! One day you can focus on pull-ups and dips the others you can concentrate on kettlebell swing! If you are willing, then go ahead! You can use something else instead of a machine something like a pull-up bar that can be installed in the doorway, which is easily available! That way you can develop strength of the body and wider upper body as well! We all want a quick workout, and this might be the most convenient option that you can use at home without the use of gym and equipment.

Take it easy to push the level and progress off your limit. The idea behind it is that you develop the body and push the limit of the body. Good tip will be use battle ropes to help with warming up the wrist as well so you can do the movement to warm up. Select a light kettle bell to do the movement at start and progress! The idea behind it is to make sure you take 20-40 Total reps in one go! Then when you go with the battle rope go hard for a minute! Then do push-ups and repeat! Doing that three times will count to around 10 minutes!

### The ideal number of sets

18 sets for each muscle group per week is something that will be awesome. When you do a compound movement that essentially utilizes more muscles than the same recipe applies.

The ideal is, train 3-4 times a week with 6 sets for each session as muscle protein synthesis takes around 48-72 hours and the muscle will be recovered.


### The magic 300 swings a day

The Beauty of doing 300 swings is that it’s not too much and it’s not too little. Once you get accustomed to the weight, you will be able to do 70-100 swings in one set, and then you can move to a heavier weight depending on if you want to build muscle or not I would always recommend going heavier as you become so much stronger.

Well, there are workouts that you can do to keep you filled with energy throughout the day. Some people will meditate instead of having lunch. Some people will go for a jog. One thing that I did with testing is to have the kettlebell at the office and home. A highly paid job is usually stationary especially the one that's demands you to sit in front of the computer, our bodies were not designed that way. Our body requires the blood flow to be pushed and maintained but doing a workout can elevate the growth hormone and the blood flow. But do you want to spend time to travel to the gym, if your targets are high then should you? But if your priorities are elsewhere and your workout to have a greater mental clarity than I recommend having what I call kettlebell break when you do a set of swings any 2 to 3 hours when you feel you want to stand up. For guys, it’s even more important as the body has lower levels of testosterone if you sit for an hour or more. It can drop by 90%, and for guys, it’s very important as their mental process goes sideways and only down if it lowers too much. So I recommend to do some kettlebell swings as it also spikes the testosterone and it helps the cardiovascular system to get a hit, and the way the movement happen helps the movement of the lymphatic fluid which also carries the fatty acids, so you burn the fat as it becomes more accessible for the body. So knowing all this make sure you do a proper form and that you train your body to it in a way that will help the body perform its functions well.

So, the point is to have the feeling that when you get too stationary and the body doesn’t feel to move, you can get your brain work with a higher clarity after doing a kettlebell swing set. If you want to do the 300 swings thought if you want to do more this depends on your obsession.

One main reason to do the kettlebell swing is that, it uses more of your body than any other workout with a convenient aspect

Try it for a day and see what happens, you will be amazed at how your state will be so much elevated.

Mainly with the calories, you can surely know if you will burn more than a 1000 calories with that swing session if you use a kettlebell between 30-40 pounds, now imagine how many calories you will burn when you use a 70-pound kettlebell.

Also, constant push on your cardiovascular system will tell your body what you need to be able to transport its oxygen which will spill over on the nutrients as well. Well if you are traveling, do 100-300 burpees in a day or just a morning session.



### Cardio HIIT

Now we will discuss in the full details that the body is the expression of yourself, and to get the most expression out of exercise; you have to select the one that does the most gene expression. The one that does that is HIIT training. The research did a measure of around 7000 epigenetic markers, and HIIT activates more than any other exercise of them. Now the kettlebell swing is HIIT training as if you do 20 swings and rest for a minute or two, and then do that five times, that places it in this category, but if you know how to do the HIIT, then you are sorted wherever you are. So if you want to be fitter, stronger and more intelligent babies then do this as an epigenetic pass to the future generations as well.

With regards to Epigenetics with HIIT training, you are telling your genetics that you have to output more energy in a shorter time window; therefore the total output has to increase, and endurance too as your lungs has to inhale more oxygen into the system. This activates a specific part of the genetics, and the idea of the epigenetic is that your body will activate specific parts of the genome and switch off other ones - activating strong one and switching off the weak ones.

When you train in a hungry state, you will also make more mitochondria, which essentially is a great thing for the body. My measuring indicator is rowing, as it uses the whole body and burns calories like a furnace. That way, you will train your body to extract energy from storage quicker and recover for the next set much faster as well. To start your HIIT cardio, you can make it like this: Warm up for 3-5 minutes, then do high-intensity interval for 30 seconds. After that, low-intensity interval for 1 minute, and repeat that three times. "There is also a way of shortening the intervals, see what you like more just stop and do five deep breaths as low intensity," and finish it off with a cool-down for 3-5 minutes. With every week, you can lower the low-intensity period and increase high-intensity period, and you can increase resistance and also the number of sets. I don't recommend having a session longer than 45 minutes, as it's intense, and if you overdo it, your body will start to produce cortisol, which will reverse the results. This exercise focuses on density if you think about it. Density is all about doing more in a shorter period, which will result in greater performance on many levels. Rowing is a great way of building a great posture for the back, to make sure that you are not lounging, and that way, you also build confidence.

An advantage of HIIT is that you reach your mental limits quicker, and then you start to go for psychological limits that are essentially responsible for self-control. The mind tells you to stop, but at this time, your brain dominates instead and, therefore, develops. While doing HIIT, you can also watch some lectures, series, whatever keeps you occupied.

HIIT exercise helps with endocrine system control, as you basically tell your body to explode to the maximum and relax as quickly as possible, and so when in life, you see that you are about to explode because someone called you something, you will more likely be able to control yourself as you did that 20 times in the morning. So the HIIT training will help you take control of your adrenaline and the speed the blood starts to rush, and the speed you can slow down, this way is beneficial to train to relax as quickly as possible. Now imagine being able to explode any second just because you decide to not because you are stressed!

When exercising this way, your body will be able to utilize the fat much more efficiently and will less likely be hungry in the long run. I don't feel the hunger after those types of exercises, to the point that I have to force myself to eat. There are studies to show that VO2 Max increases with intermittent fasting that helps extract more oxygen and that trains your lungs.

Doing exercise in a fasted state can increase the human growth hormone by 2000%, which will lead to an increase in lean muscle mass that is counter-intuitive in some way. The brain is hunting, so it will reward you by making you better for the hunt next time! Make sure you do cardio after the strength training; it's all about the glycogen and in strength training, you require the glycogen in the system to push harder. If you do cardio before strength training, you deplete the glycogen reserves, and therefore will not go hard.

If you have a choice that your body will use 100 calorie burn in five minutes or 15 minutes. When do you think your body will become stronger and will have to change itself most, then why would you do a long strenuous cardio exercise?

Your body is a protein-producing machine. Every protein expression is an expression of life. To create life, you have to create the protein, and genetic code and markers have to be triggered to tell the body to react in one way or the other.

After years of experimentation, I've reached a level which I aim to get a great exercise while giving the rest for at least a day as the body needs it after a good workout. So I decided to find two exercises that I can progress super easy while keeping the risk of injury as easy as possible. The reason why I decided to keep two exercises is to give an adequate amount of rest in between. If you can't be bothered to switch, just do one of them 3-5 times a week, it's your choice.

Here is the example of week one breakdown. Day 1, 3, 5 Kettlebell swing. Total Rep Range 100 with a target of 10-20 Reps each set, make the weights heavier to keep the rep range between 10-20 reps with some pushups. Day 2, 4, 6 Rowing or Battle Ropes Total of 20 Minutes with 30-45 second intervals Making around 8-12 intervals.

The super set 2. Repeat 2-4 Kettlebells swings. Pull-ups, Dips, Plank with weights. OR like in the master ritual which will be at the end. But for that, you need to increase your VO2 max, and that takes some time.

As for a super set 3 Kettlebell swings and push-ups, you can rotate and do three sets anyways, and that's a really good wake up to start with.

For other sessions, Rowing Station, Elliptical, Assault bike, Punching bag, Battle ropes, Whole body vibration machines, weights and Yoga mat. They are easily available and create low impact for joints. You can easily warm-up and go crazy. Variety is important to keep things interesting.

Also, if you are focusing on the upper body for strength, you can concentrate on cardio for upper body, that way, you will tire the muscle completely and make sure to switch it up to the lower body part cardio like bicycle, and that way, and you will burn more calories. The use of battle ropes as upper body cardio can be a solution or a hand bike.

“If you are looking at how the hormonal changes happen in the body, I bet you will love it as the body creates high growth hormone”.


### Fasted training.

Doing workout few hours before your breakfast in the morning is the way to go. Fasting will best produce visible results when you work out in the morning. Working out in the morning encourages Lipolysis - the breakdown of fats by hydrolysis to release fatty acids and that give you energy. It's important that you eat well otherwise you will lose essential muscles if you work out without food.

Your body utilizes 2 to 3 times more fat when you are in the fasted state and that's the period when you have a baseline of insulin. At high levels of insulin in your body, cardio will not do much but at low level of insulin, cardio is effective. Hence, the reason why you should workout during the fasted state. If you want to burn stubborn belly fat, you should do your cardio in a deep fasted state as it promotes blood flow to the areas where you want to see results.

During the fasting state, you are in a fight or flight mode where you have activated your sympathetic nervous system that keeps you focused. Also during the HIIT workout, you also trigger the sympathetic neurons system. The combination of both helps to activate faster mobilization of fat tissues that allows the rapid consumption of fat tissue and increased growth hormone.

During fasting, you also experience the increased efficiency of cyclic amp which essential helps to deliver information to the cells of the body. Fasting is more like a command to the body to become better.

Another thing that happens to your body when you fast is that the AMP kinase sees to the regulation and dispersion of energy throughout the cells and this stimulates fat burning.

Also, when you engage in weight training, you increase lactic acid and that stimulates growth hormone. As such, kettle bell is a great exercise to do during fasting.

### For longevity.

Trust me, a lot of walking is effective for longevity. VO2 max is important, and this essentially shows how strong your lungs are. The stronger the lungs, the more oxygen you get into your system when you need, the more strength you will have in future to carry out actions.

Do more of Kettle bell swing as it helps to increase mobility while you develop the posterior chain responsible for walking. Also, kettle Bell exercise helps to develop the structure of the body parts whose functions is to help the body perform daily tasks better. Also, kettle bell swing helps to build upper body muscles that gives the body a nice shape.

If you are really keen on living long, you should consider eating healthy and working out.

### To build the muscle size

Put your muscle under tension of 8-12 reps with 5 seconds up and 5 seconds down to make your muscle have longer period under tension 80-130 seconds usually is ideal after that it hit’s diminishing returns. To build your muscle size, what you need to do is to select the exercise that will target the muscles you want to build and then work effortlessly to reach your muscle building goals.

### A few tips to build muscle:

You have to load the muscle to the limit and give it a rest to recover and build. You can circulate the focus with your upper and lower body. You can do back, legs, arms, and chest, or you can do compound movement and not care, but make sure whatever you do, you do use your head.

For building muscles, you have to make sure that your set has 5-12 reps, for strength, 1-5 reps and, for endurance, everything above 12. Try doing drop sets to fatigue more muscles. You can lower the drop set by 10-20% with every set, and that will help with building the muscle size.

Progression is the key! Because over time, you create more and more veins for the activity and as you age, your muscle mass lowers. So, in order to live longer and keep yourself mobile, you need to engage in baby building exercises.

Be careful not to over-train your bones and joints as it takes long for your bones and joints to recover when you over-train them. Ensure you warm up your body first before engaging in exercise. Also, make sure to finish with compound movement so as to take care of the muscles beneath the ones you see on the outside.

If your target is to build muscles, note that you have to stretch after doing upper body specifically to avoid closing up the veins on the top of the body and limit blood flow to the head.

An exercise routine referred to as Colorado experiment is the type that make one marvel at the exercises that can be done within 28 minutes, 3 times per week and obtain a heavy amount of workload. There is a whole routine that you can check out and do it if you want. The Colorado experiment is mainly for muscle building though it has a lot of upsides. The experiment requires isolated machines, and if you are in the gym, it demands you to be uninterupted. It's basically a set of exercises non-stop with a mindset that you are going to target many muscles and have a lot of pain doing so. Once it's over, you will be tired, but that is essentially the way to build muscle super quick.

### Finishing exercise

My personal finishing exercise routines are a rotation of between the plank and pull-ups with dips. Plank, because it's a stoic exercise to push you through the pain. Pull-ups and dips for stronger wider chest and back, which is a very compound movement and also uses a lot of muscle tissue and energy. If some muscles were forgotten in isolation exercises, then those exercises will tackle them. There are other compound exercises you can try to add, such as bench press or bar pulls.

### Finishing stretch

Stretching is important as it helps to lower the level of cortisol in the body. This in turn helps to improve blood flow thereby all spine the body cells to receive more nutrients and send a positive feedback loop to the brain.

Finish with four basic axis stretch of the frontal bend, backward bend, left to right, and right to left. It disengages spinal disks, thereby increasing the blood flow between the disks. When doing the plank, train your core strength to push your stomach in and position your internal organs when you push your stomach in.

As you age, your muscles relax and doing the plank allows the body to have a healthier position of internal organs, less internal body fat, and better looks overall. Over time, try this pose from yoga instead of backward bend called Supta-Vajrasana.


### The results to measure

Which results should you measure? For Looks, measure body fat; you can also measure your weight, but at a certain point when you gain muscle, you gain weight too, especially when you are below 15% body fat. You can check out pictures online to compare or measure using specific tools, but know that they have some errors between them and they will show different results between themselves.

How much is considered as a healthy body fat? The percentage is 9-11% for a man, and 15-20% for a woman. It also depends on your genetics and the activities you engage in.

For Flexibility, well, how far you can reach specific poses. I'd advise that you try forward bend as it's the easiest measure for flexibility.

For endurance; rowing is a good measure. Measure the time it takes for you to row 5000 meters.

You can measure that with the specific tools, or you can do the HIIT and see if you are progressing with an amount of calories burned. Making the high-intensity interval longer should increase your VO2 max. For muscle size, you can measure the muscle size with a measuring tape.

To measure speed, measure jumping jacks in a minute, and you can do it with battle ropes to make it harder. Place the weight scale next to the mirror where you brush your teeth to measure weight so you don’t have to bring it out everytime.

I do recommend to measure the number of swings you can do within one session.


### Supplements

Supplements can make your heart heavy, as such I recommend that you stick with electrolytes such as potassium and magnesium if you are low on veggies and also vitamin d3 if you live in areas with low sun exposure.


### When to train.

You can train anytime. Pick a specific time of the day to train and your body will adapt to the cycle and allocate the hormones at the right time for next day.

 You can set for convenience in the morning, so social events don't grab you out of the routine. Generally speaking, evenings are good for breaking your records, as you will most likely do that as your body is more warmed up.

When it comes down to the days of exercise, it's important that you give yourself enough time to recover and for your joints and muscles to heal.


### Bonus tricks

####Time machine

To make the time fly super quick, you can do this. Listen to the same song, and that will set you into a zone so time will fly really quickly.

#### Accountability

To keep yourself accountable, get yourself a coach or an app that records your progress. Also, you can work out with a friend who will measure your performance and return the favor by doing the same.

#### The must use of plank

Do the handstand plank every morning and I promise that you will see noticeable results. Planking is effective for muscle development. Planking helps to develop the joints and makes them more flexible. Also, it helps to develop the back and body posture. So, I recommend that you finish your exercise routine with planks. However, laziness gets the best of us and we are unable to finish our exercise routine with planks.

#### Stand up every hour

Endeavor to stand up every hour. Your blood flow decreases a lot when you sit down, especially when you sit for the whole day. The worst case scenario is sitting too much can lead to muscle atrophy.

#### Use Rings if can

Use rings in the place of pull up bars. When you use rings, you will train more muscles as balancing muscles will begin to work with you.

#### Regarding overtraining

What if we had the measurement of the heart health that could have been prevented Bruce Lee from having a stroke?  What if we had all the information about him before? That way we would have ensured that he lived a little while longer delivering the best martial arts. When you train, you have to make sure you do so with recovery in mind.

#### Martial Hunter

We have the body to hunt and to make sure that we survive. Training for muscles size was not really designed by nature. What I would suggest is to learn martial arts to make sure that when you need to defend yourself, you will be able to.

#### Exercise routines to do on travels

When I travel and don't have the kettle bell or barbell, I do pushups, sit ups and plank. Then I repeat the routine few times during the day to keep my blood circulation and metabolism going. Also, I do sit ups, jumping jacks, burpees hand stands lunges and jumping lunges. Essentially you can focus on lower body, then shift to upper body and do it all over again. Give your body enough time to rest and recover before you continue.

When on travels, you can go for a run. Go and run at different places and see the city! This way you can truly explore! Preferably in the morning.
