From the conclusion:

>The balance of life
>
> Life is a balance, make sure whatever you do, you are not too engaged in one thing and that your life is a balance and variety. Make sure that whatever you do, you do with love and with energy. I wish you luck and success in your endeavors. It took me years to write this, and a lifetime to understand it. I kept it short so that you can get the most valuable information. I didn't go deep with the tools as they always change, and are different to every environment. I went with principles instead of describing the tools I went with describing the activities, systems and building blocks of them, so you can mold them and apply them anywhere. Now you know what happens and how your body reacts to the world around it go explore deeper and be a good samaritan pass the knowledge.
